  <h2 class='c013'>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><i>My</i> Modern Architecture: Romanticism and Reintegration
<i>appeared in 1929. It was an early attempt to relate the newest
architecture of the nineteen-twenties to that of the preceding century
and a half. In the thirty years that followed I have studied, in
varying degrees of detail, many aspects of the story of architecture
in the last two hundred years, from the ‘Romantic’ gardens of the mid
eighteenth century to Latin-American building of the mid twentieth. In
the process debts of gratitude have accumulated that can never be
discharged, least of all here. Moreover, immediately before writing
this book I visited a dozen countries in the New World, and during its
composition in London—made possible by a sabbatical leave from Smith
College for the academic year 1955-6—I visited another dozen in the
Old World. It would be manifestly impossible even to list all
those—first of all in England and America, but also all the way from
Athens to Bogotá—who assisted me in various ways in the gathering of
material. They will, I trust, understand and accept this generalized
expression of my thanks.</i></p>
<p class='c010'><i>Not least of the problems of preparing such a book as this is the
finding of photographs. The names of the photographers responsible for
the plates (or in a few cases those who obtained photographs for me)
are given in the list of plates. The material for the figures, mostly
redrawn for this book by P. J. Darvall, came largely from books and
drawings in the libraries of the Royal Institute of British Architects
and the Victoria and Albert Museum, to whose authorities my thanks are
due, as also for notable assistance of various other sorts. The
co-operation of the National Buildings Record, which was generously
ready to add to their so extensive files photographs newly taken for
use in this book, deserves specific mention here. In certain other
cases I am not quite sure whether photographs were taken especially
for me or not, but I must express gratitude in this connexion also to
Professor Frederick D. Nichols of the University of Virginia, to the
Staatliche Landesbildstelle of Hamburg, to the Institut für
Denkmalpflege of Schwerin, and to Professor Donald Egbert of Princeton
University.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><i>The notes indicate a considerable number of the fellow scholars who
have assisted me in one way or another. But I would like to mention
more particularly the following, who were good enough to read chapters
or sections covering matters of which they had expert knowledge: John
Summerson, Dorothy Stroud, John Brandon-Jones, Fello Atkinson, Robin
Middleton, Turpin Bannister, Winston Weisman, James Grady, William
Jordy, and Reyner Banham, not to speak of the Editor of the Pelican
History of Art, whose contribution in a field especially his own was
naturally of the utmost value. Needless to say these friends bear no
responsibility for what appears here, but the importance of their
contribution will often be very apparent in the notes. Robert
Rosenblum did a very large part of the work of gathering the
bibliography, a notable service to the author of a book such as this,
as well as checking innumerable note references.</i></p>

<p class='c010'><i>Finally I must mention Mary Elkington, whose intelligent typing of
successive drafts of the manuscript made revision a pleasure.</i></p>

  <h2 class='c013'>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c022'><i><span class='sc'>The</span> present edition is no drastic revision of the original one. Only
a paragraph or two has been omitted or rewritten, and the one wholly
new section is the <a href='#epi'>Epilogue</a>. However, very many corrections and
additions have been made in detail, following suggestions made by
reviewers and including facts supplied by others, notably John
Jacobus, Robin Middleton, Pieter Singelenberg, John Harris, Fritz
Novotny, Malcolm Quantrill, Carroll Meeks, and Kevin Dynan
among a host of correspondents who have kindly answered specific
queries or volunteered relevant information. No changes have been
made in the <a href='#figs'>Figures</a> and only about a dozen in the Plates, chiefly at
the end where it was possible to introduce the influential work of
Aalto and characteristic examples of late Japanese work by reducing
the Latin-American representation, not to speak of important works
by Wright, Le Corbusier, and Mies completed since the original
edition was prepared. The sources of the new photographs are
indicated in the <a href='#plates'>List of Plates</a>, but I must specially thank Messrs
Hentrich and Johnson, among the architects, for their assistance and
also J. M. Richards of the</i> Architectural Review <i>from whose files
come the Japanese material and one of the Aalto illustrations</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'><i>A certain number of new <a href='#notes'>Notes</a> (indicated by a letter after the
number) have been added and many were largely rewritten. The
Bibliography has been extended to include titles posterior to the
date of the original edition.</i></p>

  <h2 id='intro' class='c013'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> round numbers of chronology have no necessary
significance historically. Centuries as cultural entities often begin
and end decades before or after the hundred-year mark. The years
around 1800, however, do provide a significant break in the history of
architecture, not so much because of any major shift in style at that
precise point as because the Napoleonic Wars caused a general hiatus
in building production. The last major European style, the Baroque,
had been all but dissolved away in most of Europe. The beginnings of
several differing kinds of reaction against it—Academic in Italy,
Rococo in France, Palladian in England—go back as far as the first
quarter of the century; shortly after the mid century there came a
more concerted stylistic revolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>1750 and 1790 the new style that is called ‘Romantic Classicism’<a id="r1"></a><a href='#f1' class='c025'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
took form, producing by the eighties its most remarkable projects, and
even before that some executed work of consequence in France and in
England. Thus the nineteenth century could inherit the tradition of a
completed architectural revolution, and at its very outset was in
possession of a style that had been fully mature for more than a
decade. The most effective reaction against the Baroque in the second,
and even to some extent the third, quarter of the eighteenth century
had taken place in England; the later architectural revolution that
actually initiated Romantic Classicism centred in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet Paris was not the original locus of the new style’s gestation but
rather Rome.<a id="r2"></a><a href='#f2' class='c025'><sup>[2]</sup></a> From the early sixteenth century Rome had provided the
international headquarters from which new ideas in the arts, by no
means necessarily originated there, were distributed to the Western
world. To Rome came generation after generation of young artists,
connoisseurs, and collectors to form their taste and to formulate
their aesthetic ideals. Some even settled there for life. From the
time of Colbert the French State maintained an academic establishment
in Rome for the post-graduate training of artists. Thus French
hegemony in the arts of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries was based on a tradition maintained and renewed at Rome. The
nationals of other countries came to Rome more informally, and were
for the most part supported by their own funds or by private patrons;
only in the seventies were young English architects of promise first
awarded travelling studentships by George III. In the fifties the
number of northern architects studying in Rome notably increased; some
of them, beginning with the Scot Robert Mylne (1734-1811) in 1758, won
prizes in the competitions held by the Roman Academy of St Luke.<a id="r3"></a><a href='#f3' class='c025'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The initiation of Romantic Classicism was by no means solely in the
hands of architects. In the mid-century period of Roman gestation,
Winckelmann, Gavin Hamilton, and Piranesi—a German archaeologist, a
Scottish painter, and a Venetian etcher—played significant roles, as
well as various architects, some <i>pensionnaires</i> of the French
Academy, others Britons studying on their own. Certain aspects of
Romantic Classicism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>(1720-78), not the projects in his <i>Prima parte di architettura</i>
of 1743 or the plates of ruins in his <i>Antichità romane</i> of 1748
but his fanciful Carceri dating from the mid 1740s. On the theoretical
side the <i>Essai sur l’architecture</i> of M.-A. Laugier (1713-70),
which first appeared anonymously in 1751 with further editions in
1752, 1753, and 1755, had something of real consequence to contribute
as a basic critique of the dying Baroque style. In simple terms
Laugier may be called both a Neo-Classicist and a Functionalist. The
bolder functionalist ideas of an Italian Franciscan Carlo Lodoli
(1690-1761) as presented by Francesco Algarotti in his <i>Lettere
sopra l’architettura</i>, beginning in 1742, and in his <i>Saggio
sopra l’architettura</i> of 1756 were also influential. However,
despite all the new archaeological treatises inspired by the Roman
milieu, of which the first was the <i>Ruins of Palmyra</i> published
in 1753 by Robert Wood (1717-71), and all the excavations undertaken
at Herculaneum over the years 1738-65 and those at Pompeii beginning a
decade later, the first architectural manifestations of Romantic
Classicism did not occur on Italian soil.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two buildings begun in the late 1750s, one a very large church in
France completed only in 1790, the other a mere garden pavilion in
England, may be considered to announce the architectural revolution:
Sainte-Geneviève in Paris, desecrated and made a secular Panthéon in
1791 immediately after its completion, was designed by J.-G. Soufflot
(1713-80);<a id="r4"></a><a href='#f4' class='c025'><sup>[4]</sup></a> the Doric Temple at Hagley Park in Worcestershire is by
his exact contemporary James Stuart (1713-88). The Panthéon remains
one of the most conspicuous eighteenth-century monuments of Paris; the
Hagley temple is familiar today only to specialists. Yet,
historically, Stuart’s importance is rather greater than Soufflot’s,
even though his production was almost negligible in quantity. Born and
partly trained in Lyons, Soufflot studied early in Rome and returned
to Italy again in the middle of the century. Like several of the
French theorists of the day, he had had a lively interest in Gothic
construction from his Lyons days. He owed his selection to design
Sainte-Geneviève in 1755 to his friendship with Louis XV’s Directeur
Général des Bâtiments, the Marquis de Marigny, brother of Mme de
Pompadour, whom he had accompanied to Italy in 1749 along with the
influential critics C.-N. Cochin and the Abbé Leblanc.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Scottish architect James Stuart had also gone to Rome, and formed
there as early as 1748 the project of visiting Athens; by 1751 he was
on his way, accompanied by Nicholas Revett (<i>c.</i> 1721-1804), with
whom he proposed to produce an archaeological work on the
<i>Antiquities of Athens</i>. The publication of the first volume of
this epoch-making book was delayed until 1762. In the meantime, in
1758, the year Stuart designed his Hagley temple, J.-D. Leroy
(1724-1803) got ahead of him by publishing <i>Les Ruines des plus
beaux monuments de la Grèce</i>; but the very pictorial and inaccurate
plates in this had little practical effect on architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The significance of Stuart’s temple may be readily guessed; small
though it is, this fabrick was the first example of the re-use of the
Greek Doric order<a id="r5"></a><a href='#f5' class='c025'><sup>[5]</sup></a>—so barbarous, or at least so primitive, in
appearance to mid-eighteenth-century eyes—and the first edifice to
attempt an archaeological reconstruction of a Greek temple. By the
fifties many architects and critics were ready to accept the primacy
of Greek over Roman art, if not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>little or no knowledge of Greek architecture several French writers
before Laugier had praised it. J. J. Winckelmann also recommended
Greek rather than Roman models in his <i>Gedanken über die Nachahmung
der Griechischen Werke</i> (Dresden, 1755) published just before he
settled in Rome.<a id="r6"></a><a href='#f6' class='c025'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Out of Italian chauvinism Piranesi attacked the theory of Grecian
primacy in the arts; yet before his death he had prepared an
impressive and influential set of etchings of the Greek temples at
Paestum which his son Francesco published. In 1760, moreover, Piranesi
decorated the Caffè Inglese in Rome in an Egyptian mode. Eventually
Greek precedent in detail all but superseded Roman for over a
generation; yet a real Greek Revival, at best but one aspect of
Romantic Classicism, did not mature until after 1800. There was never
a widespread Egyptian Revival,<a id="r7"></a><a href='#f7' class='c025'><sup>[7]</sup></a> but Egyptian inspiration did play a
real part in crystallizing the formal ideals of Romantic Classicism;
it also provided certain characteristic architectural forms, such as
the pyramid and the obelisk, and occasional decorative details.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soufflot’s vast cruciform Panthéon provides no such simple paradigm as
Stuart’s temple. No longer really Baroque, it is by no means
thoroughly Romantic Classical. Like most of the work of the leading
British architect of Soufflot’s generation, Robert Adam (1728-92),<a id="r8"></a><a href='#f8' class='c025'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
the Panthéon must rather be considered stylistically transitional. For
example, the purity of the temple portico at the front, in any case
Roman not Grecian, is diminished by the breaks at its corners. The
tall, hemispherical dome<a id="r9"></a><a href='#f9' class='c025'><sup>[9]</sup></a> over the crossing is even less antique in
character, owing its form to Wren’s St Paul’s rather than to the Roman
Pantheon, which was the favourite domical model for later Romantic
Classicists. In the interior, up to the entablatures, the columniation
is Classical enough and the structure entirely trabeated<a id="r10"></a><a href='#f10' class='c025'><sup>[10]</sup></a>—at least
in appearance (Plate <a href='#pl001'>1</a>). Above, the domes in the four arms are
perhaps Roman, but hardly the pendentives that carry them; these are,
of course, a Byzantine structural device revived in the fifteenth
century by Brunelleschi. Over the aisles the cutting away of the
masonry and the general statical approach, while not producing
anything that <i>looks</i> very Gothic, illustrate the results of
Soufflot’s long-pursued study of Gothic vaulting. Many aspects of
nineteenth-century architectural development were thus presaged by
Soufflot here, as will become very evident later
(see Chapters <a href='#ch01'>1</a>-<a href='#ch03'>3</a>, <a href='#ch06'>6</a>, and <a href='#ch07'>7</a>).<a id="r11"></a><a href='#f11' class='c025'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Panthéon was finally finished in the decade after Soufflot’s death
by his own pupil Maximilien Brébion (1716-<i>c.</i> 1792), J.-B.
Rondelet (1743-1829), a pupil of J.-F. Blondel, and Soufflot’s nephew
(François, ?-<i>c.</i> 1802). Well before that, a whole generation of
French architects had developed a mode, similar to Adam’s in England,
which is usually called, despite its initiation long before Louis XV’s
death in 1774, the <i>style Louis XVI</i>. Whether or not this mode in
its inception owed much to English inspiration is still controversial.
In any case it was widely influential outside France from the
seventies to the nineties, and in those decades both French-born and
French-trained designers were in great demand all over Europe, except
in England; and even in England French craftsmen were employed. With
that completely eighteenth-century phase of architectural history this
book cannot deal, even though most of the architects who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>after 1800 had first made their reputation under Louis XVI, or even
earlier under Louis XV. The <i>style Louis XVI</i> and the English
‘Adam Style’ were over, except in remote provinces and colonial
dependencies, by 1800.</p>

<p class='c010'>In various executed works of the decades preceding the French
Revolution it is possible to trace the gradual emergence of mature
Romantic Classicism in France, as also to some extent in the executed
buildings and, above all, the projects of the younger George Dance
(1741-1825)<a id="r12"></a><a href='#f12' class='c025'><sup>[12]</sup></a> in England. But it is in the extraordinary designs,
dating from the eighties, by two French architects a good deal younger
than Soufflot that the new ideals were most boldly and completely
visualized. In the last twenty-five years these two men, L.-E. Boullée
(1728-99) and C.-N. Ledoux (1736-1806), have increasingly been
recognized as the first great masters of Romantic Classical
<i>design</i> if not, in the fullest sense, the first great Romantic
Classical <i>architects</i>. Boullée built little and few of his
projects and none of the manuscript of his book on architecture, both
now preserved at the Bibliothèque Nationale, were published—or at
least not until modern times.<a id="r13"></a><a href='#f13' class='c025'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Yet they must have been well known to
his many pupils—including J.-N.-L. Durand, who was the author of the
most influential architectural treatise of the Empire period, and
doubtless to others as well (see Chapters <a href='#ch02'>2</a> and <a href='#ch03'>3</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Ledoux was from the first a very successful architect, working with
assurance and considerable versatility in the <i>style Louis XVI</i>
from the late sixties, particularly for Mme du Barry. He became an
academician and <i>architecte du roi</i> in 1773 and spent the next
few years at Cassel in Germany. His major executed works are in
France, however, and belong to the late seventies and eighties. These
are the Besançon Theatre of 1775-84, the buildings of the Royal
Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans near there of 1775-9—he had been made
<i>inspecteur</i> of the establishment in 1771—and the
<i>barrières</i> or toll-houses of Paris, which were built in 1784-9
just before the Revolution. In this later work most of the major
qualities of his personal style, qualities carried to much greater
extremes in his projects, are readily recognizable; his earlier work
was of rather transitional character and not at all unlike what many
other French architects of his generation were producing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The massive cube of the exterior of Ledoux’s Besançon Theatre, against
which an unpedimented Ionic portico is set, can already be found,
however, at his Château de Benouville begun in 1768; the later edifice
is nevertheless much more rigidly cubical and much plainer in the
treatment of the rare openings. In the interior Ledoux substituted for
a Baroque horseshoe with tiers of boxes a hemicycle<a id="r14"></a><a href='#f14' class='c025'><sup>[14]</sup></a> with rising
banks of seats and a continuous Greek Doric colonnade around the rear
fronting the gallery. The extant constructions at Arc-et-Senans are
less geometrical; instead of Greek orders there is much rustication
and also various Piranesian touches of visual drama. It was this
commission which set Ledoux to designing his ‘Ville Idéale de Chaux’;
that was his greatest achievement, even though it never came even to
partial execution, nor could perhaps have been expected to do so, so
cosmic was the basic concept.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>barrières</i> varied very widely in character; some were very
Classical, others in a modest Italianate vernacular; some were rather
Piranesian in their bold rustication,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>the Besançon Theatre. The most significant, however, were notable for
the crisp and rigid geometry of their flat-surfaced masses. The extant
Barrière de St Martin in the Place de Stalingrad in the La Villette
district of Paris consists of a tall cylinder rising out of a very
low, square block; this is intersected by a cruciform element
projecting as three pedimented porticoes beyond the edges of the
square (Plate <a href='#pl002a'>2<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Although the range of Ledoux’s
restricted detail here is not very great, it is varied to the point of
inconsistency all the same. The rather heavy piers of the porticoes
are square, with capitals simplified from the Grecian Doric; yet
around the cylinder extends an open arcade of Italian character
carried on delicate coupled columns.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had Ledoux’s ideas been known only from his executed work, he would
probably not have been especially influential; certainly he would not
have attained with posterity the very high reputation that is his
today. Inactive at building after the Revolution—he was even
imprisoned for a while in the nineties—he concentrated on the
publication of his designs both executed and projected. His book
<i>L’Architecture considérée sous le rapport de l’art, des mœurs et de
la législation</i> appeared in 1804, and a second edition was
published by Daniel Ramée (1806-87) in 1846-7. This book has a long
and fascinating text which is sociological as much as it is
architectural; but it is in its plates, both of executed work and
projects, that Ledoux’s originality can best be appreciated. By no
means all of his ideas, known before the Revolution to his pupils and
undoubtedly to many others as well, passed into the general repertory
of Romantic Classicism; some of the most extreme are hardly buildable.
The ‘House for Rural Guards’ is a free-standing sphere, a form that he
utilized as space rather than mass in the interior of a project for a
Columbarium. For the ‘Coopery’, the coopers’ products dictated the
target-like shape (Plate <a href='#pl002b'>2<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The ‘House for the
Directors of the Loue River’ is also a cylinder set horizontally, but
a much more massive one, through which the whole flood of the river
was to pour to the thorough discomfort, one would imagine, of the
inhabitants. Even where the forms are more conventional, as in the
project for the church of his ‘Ville Idéale’ of Chaux—a purified
version of Soufflot’s Panthéon: cruciform, temple-porticoed, and with
a Roman saucer dome—or for the bank there—a peristylar rectangle with
high, plain attic, flanked at the corners by detached cubic lodges—the
clarity and originality of his formal thinking is very evident, and
was apparently influential well before his book actually appeared in
1804. Masses are of simple geometrical shapes, discrete and boldly
juxtaposed; walls are flat and as little broken as possible, the few
necessary openings mere rectangular holes. Minor features are repeated
without variation of rhythm in regular reiterative patterns; the top
surfaces of the masses, whether flat, sloping, or rounded, are
considered as bounding planes, not modelled plastically in the Baroque
way.<a id="r15"></a><a href='#f15' class='c025'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Much of this is common to the projects of Boullée, more widely known
than Ledoux’s in the eighties because of his many pupils. The simple
geometrical forms, the plain surfaces, the reiterative handling of
minor features, all are even more conspicuous in his designs and
generally presented at a scale so grand as to approach megalomania
(Plate <a href='#pl002c'>2<span class='fss'>C</span></a>). Boullée could be, and often was, more
conventionally the Classical Revivalist than Ledoux; he was also
perhaps somewhat less bold in using such shapes as the sphere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>cube and the pyramid. His inspiration was on occasion medieval (of a
very special South European ‘Castellated’ order), and he thereby laid
the foundations for that more widely eclectic use of the forms of the
past which makes the Romantic Classical a syncretic style, not a mere
revival of Roman or Greek architecture. Various projects of the
eighties by younger men, such as Bernard Poyet (1742-1824) and L.-J.
Desprez (1743-1804), of whom we will hear again later, were of very
similar character.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both Boullée and Ledoux, but particularly Ledoux, were interested in
symbolism. In that sense their architecture was not essentially
abstract, despite the extreme geometrical simplicity of their forms,
but in their own term <i>parlante</i> or expressive and meaningful. So
special and personal is most of their symbolism, however, that even
when quite obvious, as with the ‘Coopery’, it was hardly viable for
other architects. When Ledoux gave to his <i>Oikema</i> or ‘House of
Sexual Education’ an actual <i>plan</i> of phallic outline (which
would be wholly unnoticeable except from the air) he epitomized the
hermetic quality of much of his architectural speech. It is
understandable that, of the many who accepted his architectural
syntax, very few really attempted to speak his language. Such
symbolism belonged on the whole to an early stage of Romantic
Classicism; after 1800 architectural speech was generally of a much
less recondite order. Yet to each of the different vocabularies
employed by Romantic Classicists—Grecian, Egyptian, Italian,
Castellated, etc.—some sort of special meaning was commonly attached.
Thus a restricted and codified eclecticism provided, as it were, the
equivalent of a system of musical keys that could be chosen according
to a conventional code when designing different types of buildings.</p>

<p class='c010'>One cannot properly say that international Romantic Classicism derives
to any major degree from Ledoux and Boullée; one can only say that
their projects of the eighties epitomized most dramatically the final
ending of the Baroque and the crystallization of the style that
succeeded it. Many French architects of the generation of Poyet and
Desprez, however, such as J.-J. Ramée, Pompon, A.-L.-T. Vaudoyer,
L.-P. Baltard, Belanger, Grandjean de Montigny, Damesme, and Durand
(to mention only those whose names will recur later) came close to
rivalling even the grandest visions of Ledoux and Boullée in projects
prepared in the nineties.<a id="r16"></a><a href='#f16' class='c025'><sup>[16]</sup></a> After such exalted work on paper, the
buildings actually executed by this generation of Romantic Classicists
often seem rather tame. So also were the glorious social schemes of
the political revolutionaries much diluted by the functioning
governments of Consulate and Empire before and after 1800.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only in England did the decades preceding the French Revolution
produce any development in architecture at all comparable in
significance to what was taking place then in France. But there also
it is the projects rather than the executed work of Dance—of which
very little remains except his early London church of All Hallows,
London Wall, of 1765-7—that modern investigators have come to realize
led most definitely away from the transitional ‘Adam Style’ towards
Romantic Classicism. His Piranesian Newgate Prison, begun in 1769, was
demolished in 1902. By 1790, both in France and in England, the new
ideas had taken firm root, however, and other countries were not slow
to accept the mature style once it had been fully adumbrated.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>The fact that the nineteenth century began with much of Europe under
the hegemony of a French Empire does not quite justify calling the
particular phase of Romantic Classicism with which the nineteenth
century opens <i>Empire</i>, although this is frequently done in most
European countries. Yet the prestige of Napoleon’s rule, and indeed
its actual extent, ensured around 1800 the continuance of that French
leadership in architecture which had started a century earlier under
Louis XIV. Beyond the boundaries of Napoleon’s realm and the lands of
his nominees and his allies, moreover, French émigrés carried the new
architectural ideas of the last years of the monarchy—for many of them
were revolutionaries in the arts, although like Ledoux politically
unacceptable to the leaders of the Revolution in France. Even in the
homeland of Napoleon’s principal opponents, the English, the prestige
of French taste, high in the eighties, hardly declined with the
Napoleonic wars. The mature Romantic Classicism of England in the last
decade of the old century and the first of the new is certainly full
of French ideas, even though it is not always clear exactly how they
were transmitted across the Channel in war-time.</p>

<p class='c010'>If Romantic Classicism, the nearly universal style with which
nineteenth-century architecture began, was predominantly French in
origin and in its continuing ideals and standards, the same decades
that saw it reach maturity also saw the rise of another major movement
in the arts that was definitely English. The ‘Picturesque’, a critical
concept that had been increasing in authority for two generations in
England, received the dignity of a capital P in the 1790s. The term
Romantic Classicism is a twentieth-century historian’s invention,
attempting by its own contradictoriness to express the ambiguity of
the dominant mode of this period in the arts; the term Picturesque, on
the other hand, was most widely used and the concept most thoroughly
examined just before and just after 1800
(see Chapters <a href='#ch01'>1</a> and <a href='#ch06'>6</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>To the twentieth century, on the whole, the aesthetic standards of
Romantic Classicism—or perhaps one should rather say the visual
results—have been widely acceptable. The results of the application of
Picturesque principles in architecture, on the other hand, have not
been so generally admired; indeed, until lately the more clearly and
unmistakably buildings realized Picturesque ideals, the less was
usually the esteem in which they were held by posterity. On the whole,
in architecture if not in landscape design, the twentieth century has
preferred to see the manifestations of the Picturesque around 1800 as
aberrations from a norm considered primarily to have been a ‘Classical
Revival’. As the adjectival aspect of the term Romantic Classicism
makes evident, however, the Classicism of the end of the eighteenth
century and the beginning of the nineteenth was not at all the same as
that of the High Renaissance, nor even that of the Academic Reaction
of the early and middle decades of the eighteenth century. Romantic
Classicism aimed not so much towards the ‘Beautiful’, in the sense of
Aristotle and the eighteenth-century aestheticians, as towards what
had been distinguished by Edmund Burke in 1756 as the ‘Sublime’.</p>

<p class='c010'>Posterity has admired in the production of the first decades of the
nineteenth century a homogeneity of style which is in fact even more
illusory than that of earlier periods. Horrified by the chaos of later
nineteenth-century eclecticism, two twentieth-century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>have praised architects and patrons of the years before and after 1800
for a consistency that was by no means really theirs. In some ways,
and not unimportant ways, the history of architecture within the
period covered by this volume seems to come full circle so that the
Austrian art historian Emil Kaufmann could in 1933 write a book
entitled <i>Von Ledoux bis Le Corbusier</i>. Kaufmann did not live
quite long enough to realize how far from the spheres and cubes of the
Ledolcian ideal the revolutionary twentieth-century architect would
move in these last years (see Chapter <a href='#ch23'>23</a>). Le Corbusier’s
church at Ronchamp, completed in 1955 after Kaufmann’s death, seems
more in accord with extreme eighteenth-century illustrations of the
Picturesque than with characteristic monuments of Romantic Classicism
(Plate <a href='#pl167'>167</a>). Yet in the early works of the American Frank
Lloyd Wright in the 1890s and those of the German Mies van der Rohe
twenty years later a filiation to early nineteenth-century Classicism
can be readily traced; that tradition informed almost the entire
production of the French Perret, a good deal of that of the German
Behrens, and even some of the best late work of the Austrian Wagner
(see Chapters <a href='#ch18'>18</a>-<a href='#ch21'>21</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Forgetting for the moment the Picturesque, one may profitably set down
here some of the characteristics that the aspirations and the
achievements of the architects of 1800 share, or seem to share, with
those of the architects of over a century later. The preference for
simple geometrical forms and for smooth, plain surfaces is common to
both, though the earlier men aimed at effects of unbroken mass and the
later ones rather at an expression of hollow volume. The protestations
of devotion to the ‘functional’ are similar, if as frequently
sophistical in the one case as in the other. The preferred isolation
of buildings in space is as evident in the ubiquitous temples of the
early nineteenth century as in the towering slabs of the mid
twentieth. Monochromy and even monotony in the use of homogeneous
wall-surfacing materials and the avoidance of detail in relief is
balanced in both periods by an emphasis on direct structural
expression, whether the structure be the posts and lintels of a
masonry colonnade or the steel or ferro-concrete members of a
continuous space-cage. Finally, impersonality and, perhaps even more
notably, ‘internationality’ of expression provided around 1800 a
universalized sense of period rather than the flavours of particular
nations or regions, just as they have done in the last forty years.</p>

<p class='c010'>The full flood of Romantic Classicism came late, having been dammed so
long by the political and economic turmoil of the last years of the
eighteenth century and the first of the nineteenth; it also continued
late, in some areas even beyond 1850. But dissatisfaction and revolt
also started early; it is not a unique stylistic paradox that the
greatest masters of Romantic Classicism were often those who were also
most ready to explore the alternative possibilities of the Picturesque
(see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>). The architectural production of the first half
of the nineteenth century cannot therefore be presented with any
clarity in a single chronological sequence. Parallel architectural
events, even strictly contemporary works by the same architect, must
be set in their proper places in at least two different sequences of
development.</p>

<p class='c010'>The building production of the early decades of the century already
divides only too easily under various stylistic headings. A Greek
Revival, a Gothic Revival, etc., have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>fact, these and other ‘revivals’ were but aspects either of the
dominant Romantic Classical tide or of the Picturesque countercurrent
(see Chapters <a href='#ch01'>1</a>-<a href='#ch05'>5</a> and Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>, respectively).
Only the story of the increasing exploitation of new materials,
notably iron and glass, reaching some sort of a culmination around
1850, lay outside, though never quite isolated from, the realm of the
revivalistic modes (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>).</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c013'><span class='c027'>CHAPTER 1</span><br />ROMANTIC CLASSICISM AROUND 1800</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Despite</span> the drastically reduced production of the years just before and after 1800,
between the outbreak of the French Revolution and the termination of Napoleon’s
imperial career, there are prominent buildings in many countries that provide fine
examples of Romantic Classicism in its early maturity; others, generally more modest in
size, give evidence of the vitality of the Picturesque at this time. Since England and
America were least directly affected by the French Revolution, however much they
were drawn into the wars that were its aftermath, they produced more than their share,
so to say, of executed work. French architects before 1806 were mostly reduced to designing
monuments destined never to be built or to adapting old structures to new
uses.</p>
<p class='c010'>The greatest architect in active practice in the 1790s was Sir John Soane (1753-1837),
from 1788 Architect of the Bank of England. The career of his master, the younger
Dance, was in decline; he had made what were perhaps his greatest contributions a good
quarter of a century earlier. Whatever Soane owed to Dance, and he evidently owed
him a great deal, the Bank<a id="r17"></a><a href='#f17' class='c025'><sup>[17]</sup></a> offered greater opportunities than the older man had ever
had. His interiors of the early nineties at the Bank leave the world of academic Classicism
completely behind (Plate <a href='#pl003'>3</a>). His extant Lothbury façade of 1795, with the contiguous
‘Tivoli Corner’ of a decade later—now modified almost beyond recognition—and
even more the demolished Waiting Room Court (Plate <a href='#pl004a'>4<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) showed that his innovations
in this period were by no means restricted to interiors.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soane’s style, consonant though it was in many ways with the general ideals of
Romantic Classicism, is a highly personal one. At the Bank, however, he was not creating
<i>de novo</i> but committed to the piecemeal reconstruction of an existing complex of
buildings, and controlled as well by very stringent technical requirements. Thus the
grouping of the offices about the Rotunda, like the plan of the Rotunda itself, goes back
to the work done by his predecessor Sir Robert Taylor (1714-88) twenty years earlier;
while the special need of the Bank for various kinds of security made necessary both the
avoidance of openings on the exterior and a fireproof structural system within. The
architectural expression that Soane gave to his complex spaces in the offices which he
designed in 1791 and built in 1792-4 had very much the same abstract qualities as those
to which older masters of Romantic Classicism, such as Ledoux and Dance, had already
aspired in the preceding decades (Plate <a href='#pl003'>3</a>). The novel treatment of the smooth plaster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>surfaces of the light vaults made of hollow terracotta pots, where he substituted linear
striations for the conventional membering of Classical design, was as notable as the
frank revelation of the delicate cast-iron framework of his glazed lanterns
(see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>). These interiors have particularly appealed to
twentieth-century taste, while Soane’s columnar confections of this
period generally appear somewhat pompous and banal.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rotunda of 1794-5 was grander and more Piranesian in effect; thus it shared in
the international tendency of this period towards megalomania. So also the contemporary
Lothbury façade, with its rare accents of crisply profiled antae and its vast unbroken
expanses of flat rustication, is less personal to Soane and more in a mode that was
common to many Romantic Classical architects all over the Western world. The
original Tivoli Corner of 1805, however, was almost Baroque in its plasticity, with a
Roman not a Greek order, and a most remarkable piling up of flat elements organized
in three dimensions at the skyline that could only be Soane’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, the reduction of relief and the linear stylization of the constituent
elements of the Loggia in the Waiting Room Court of 1804, equally personal to Soane,
illustrated an anti-Baroque tendency to reduce to a minimum the sculptural aspect of
architecture (Plate <a href='#pl004a'>4<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Planes were emphasized rather than masses, and the character of
the detail was thoroughly renewed as well as the basic formulas of Classical design that
Soane had inherited. This was even more apparent in the New Bank Buildings, a terrace
of houses, begun in 1807, that once stood across Prince’s Street. Except for the paired
Ionic columns at the ends, conventional Classical forms were avoided almost as completely
as in the Bank offices of the previous decade, and the smooth plane of the stucco
wall was broken only by incised linear detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps the most masterly example of this characteristically Soanic treatment is still
to be seen in the gateway and lodge of the country house that he built at Tyringham
in Buckinghamshire in 1792-7 (Plate <a href='#pl006a'>6<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). There the simple mass is defined by flat surfaces
bounded by plain incised lines. The house itself is both less drastically novel and less
successful; various other Soane houses of these decades have more character.</p>

<p class='c010'>Summerson has claimed that Soane introduced all his important innovations before
1800. However that may be, there is no major break in his work at the end of the first
decade of the century, nor did his production then notably increase. It is therefore rather
arbitrary to cut off an account of his architecture at this point; but it is necessary to do
so if the importance of the Picturesque countercurrent in these same years, not as yet of
great consequence as an aspect of Soane’s major works, is to be adequately emphasized.
His concern with varied lighting effects, however, if not necessarily Picturesque technically,
gave evidence of an intense Romanticism; more indubitably Picturesque was his
exaggerated interest in broken skylines.</p>

<p class='c010'>While Soane’s work at the Bank was proceeding, in these years before and after 1800,
James Wyatt (1746-1813), capable of producing at Dodington House in 1798-1808 a
quite conventional example of Romantic Classicism, was building in the years between
1796 and his death in 1813 for that great Romantic William Beckford the largest of
‘Gothick’ garden fabricks, Fonthill Abbey in Wiltshire.<a id="r18"></a><a href='#f18' class='c025'><sup>[18]</sup></a> This was a landmark in the
rise of the Gothic Revival. In 1803 S. P. Cockerell (1754-1827), otherwise far more consistently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Classical than Wyatt, was erecting for his brother, the Indian nabob Sir Charles
Cockerell, a vast mansion in Gloucestershire in an Indian mode. The design of Sezincote
was based on early sketches made by the landscape gardener Humphry Repton (1752-1818)
and all its details were derived from the drawings Thomas Daniell (1749-1840)
had made in India fifteen years before and published in <i>The Antiquities of India</i> in 1800.
The ‘Indian Revival’ (so to call it) had little success; in these years only the stables built
in 1805 by William Porden (<i>c.</i> 1755-1822) for the Royal Pavilion at Brighton followed
Sezincote’s lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Neo-Gothic of Fonthill, however, a mode that had roots extending back into the
second quarter of the eighteenth century, is illustrated in a profusion of examples by
Wyatt, Porden, and many others. None, however, seems to have succeeded as well as
Beckford and Wyatt at Fonthill in achieving the ‘Sublime’ by mere dimension. The
characteristic Gothic country houses of this period were likely to be elaborately Tudor,
like Wyatt’s Ashridge begun in 1808 and Porden’s Eaton Hall of 1803-12, or lumpily
Castellated like Hawarden of 1804-9 by Thomas Cundy I (1765-1825) and Eastnor of
1808-15 by Sir Robert Smirke (1781-1867). The last, moreover, differs very little from
Adam’s Culzean of 1777-90.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some Gothic churches were built in these decades, too, as others had been ever since
the 1750s. Such an example as Porden’s church at Eccleston of 1809-13, while more
recognizably Perpendicular, lacked the brittle charm of the earlier ‘Gothick’ churches
of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>The virtuoso of the Picturesque mode and, after Soane, the greatest architectural
figure of these years in England, was John Nash (1752-1835). Working in partnership
with Repton for several years at the turn of the century, he turned out a spate of Picturesque
houses, many of them rather small, with various sorts of medieval detail: Killy
Moon in Ireland, built in 1803, is Norman; more usually they are Tudor or at least
Tudoresque: his own East Cowes Castle on the Isle of Wight, which was begun in 1798,
for example, or Luscombe in Devonshire, begun the following year. The medieval detail
was probably designed by the French émigré Augustus (Auguste) Charles Pugin
(1762-1832), whom Nash employed at this time (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>). It is rather for their
asymmetrical silhouettes and for the free plans that this asymmetry encouraged, however,
than for the stylistic plausibility of their detailing that these houses are notable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finer than such ‘castles’ is Cronkhill, which Nash built in 1802 at Atcham, Salop.
Here the varied forms are all more or less Italianate, and the whole was evidently inspired
by the fabricks in the paintings of Claude and the Poussins—literally an example
of ‘picturesque’ architecture. Actually more characteristic of the Picturesque at this
time, however, is the Hamlet at Blaise Castle. There Nash repeated in 1811 a variety of
cottage types that he had already used individually elsewhere, arranging them in an
irregular cluster (Plate <a href='#pl050a'>50<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Rustic Cottage mode, like so many aspects of the Picturesque in architecture, had
its origins in the fabricks designed to ornament eighteenth-century gardens. But the
mode had by now attained considerable prestige thanks to the writings of the chief
theorists of the Picturesque,<a id="r19"></a><a href='#f19' class='c025'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Richard Payne Knight (1750-1824) and Uvedale Price
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>(1747-1829). Their support was responsible also for the rising prestige of the asymmetrical
Castellated Mansion and the Italian Villa; indeed, Payne Knight’s own Downton
Castle in Shropshire of 1774-8 is both Castellated and Italianate. The appearance of
several prettily illustrated books on cottages<a id="r20"></a><a href='#f20' class='c025'><sup>[20]</sup></a> in the nineties provided a variety of
models for emulation, and from the beginning of the new century the Cottage mode
was well established for gate lodges, dairies, and all sorts of other minor constructions
in the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>For larger buildings a definite Greek Revival was now beginning to take form within
the general frame of Romantic Classicism. More young architects were visiting Greece
and, for those who could not, two further volumes of Stuart and Revett’s <i>Antiquities of
Athens</i>, appearing in 1787 and in 1794, and the parallel <i>Ionian Antiquities</i>, which began
to be issued in 1769, provided many more models for imitation than had been available
earlier. The Greek Doric order had first been introduced into England by Stuart himself
in 1758 in the Hagley Park temple, as has been mentioned earlier; a little later, in 1763,
he used the Greek Ionic on Litchfield House which still stands at 15 St James’s Square
in London. From the nineties, the Greek orders were in fairly common use, as such a
splendid group as the buildings of Chester Castle, of 1793-1820 by Thomas Harrison
(1744-1829), handsomely illustrates. However, the handling of them was not as yet very
archaeological.</p>

<p class='c010'>Summerson credits the attack made by the connoisseur Thomas Hope (1770?-1831)
in 1804 on Wyatt’s designs for Downing College, Cambridge, with helping to establish
a more rigid standard of correctness. However that may be, the winning and partly
executed design of 1806-11 for this college by William Wilkins (1778-1839) well illustrates
the new ideals. Wilkins had made his own studies of Greek originals in Sicily and
Southern Italy, and was publishing them in the <i>Antiquities of Magna Graecia</i> at this very
time (1807). The inherited concepts of medieval college architecture, largely maintained
through the earlier Georgian period, were all but forgotten at Downing. The
group was broken down into free-standing blocks, each as much like a temple as was
feasible, and repeated Ionic porticoes provided almost the only architectural features.
There was no Soanic originality here, no Picturesque eclecticism; perhaps unfortunately,
however, this provided a codified Grecian mode which almost anyone could apply from
handbooks of the Greek orders.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilkins was also responsible for the first<a id="r21"></a><a href='#f21' class='c025'><sup>[21]</sup></a> British example of a giant columnar monument,
the Nelson Pillar of 1808-9 in Dublin. This 134-foot Greek Doric column in
Sackville (now O’Connell) Street, of which the construction was supervised by Francis
Johnston (1760-1829), initiated a favourite theme of the period usually, and not incorrectly,
associated with Napoleon (see Chapter <a href='#ch03'>3</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Covent Garden Theatre in London was rebuilt in 1808-9 by Smirke. This pupil
of Soane had, like Wilkins, seen ancient Greek buildings with his own eyes and generally
aimed to imitate them very closely. His theatre was somewhat less correct than the Cambridge
college, but despite the castles he had built it was Smirke rather than Wilkins
who carried forward the Grecian mode at its most rigid through four more decades (see
Chapter <a href='#ch04'>4</a>). Wilkins, however, at Grange Park in Hampshire in 1809 had shown, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>C.-E. de Beaumont (1757-1811) had done at a country house called ‘Le Temple de
Silence’ just before the Revolution in France, how the accommodations of a fair-sized
mansion could be squeezed inside the temple form (admittedly with some violence to
the latter). Grange Park provided an early paradigm of a Grecian domestic mode
destined to be curiously popular at the fringes of the western world in America, in
Sweden, and in Russia, but very rarely employed in more sophisticated regions (see
Chapter <a href='#ch05'>5</a>). The house was much modified by later enlargements of 1823-5 by S. P.
Cockerell and of 1852 by his son C. R. Cockerell (1788-1863).</p>

<p class='c010'>Grecian design descended slowly to the world of the builders. The relatively restricted
urban house-building of the two decades before Waterloo maintained a close resemblance
to that of the 1780s. Russell Square in London, built up by James Burton (1761-1837)
in the first decade of the new century, does not differ notably from Bedford
Square of twenty years earlier—probably by Thomas Leverton (1743-1824)—except
that the façades are smoother and plainer. But a still greater crispness of finish could be,
and increasingly was, obtained by covering terrace houses—as for that matter most
suburban villas also by this time—with stucco. In this respect the work of some unknown
designer in Euston Square in London, which was built up at the same time as
Russell Square, may be happily contrasted with Burton’s (which has in any case been
much corrupted by the introduction around 1880 of terracotta door and window
casings).</p>

<p class='c010'>In industrial construction, such as the warehouses by William Jessop at the West
India Docks, begun in 1799, and those by D. A. Alexander (1768-1846) at the London
Docks, begun in 1802, the grandeur and simplicity characteristic of Romantic Classicism
can be seen at their best.<a id="r22"></a><a href='#f22' class='c025'><sup>[22]</sup></a> These warehouses also presage the importance of commercial
building in a world increasingly concerned with business (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>During the years of the American Revolutionary War, 1776-83, years in which
Romantic Classicism was maturing in France and in England, North Americans were
not entirely cut off from the Old World. Not only did many earlier cultural ties remain
unbroken—while a surprising reverse emigration of good painters from the New
World to the Old occurred—but new cultural ties with the French ally were established,
and these were maintained and reinforced by several émigrés of ability who
arrived in the 1790s. Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), hitherto as confirmed a Palladian as
any English landowner of the mid eighteenth century, was undoubtedly influenced by
his friend Clérisseau when he based his Virginia State Capitol<a id="r23"></a><a href='#f23' class='c025'><sup>[23]</sup></a> of 1785-96 at Richmond
very closely on the best preserved ancient Roman structure that he had seen in France,
the Maison Carrée at Nîmes, even though he used for the portico an Ionic instead of a
Corinthian order. In this first major public monument initiated in the new republic
Jefferson’s drastic aim of forcing all the requirements of a fairly complex modern
building inside the rigid mould of a Roman temple was more consonant with the
absolutism of the French in this period than with the rather looser formal ideals of the
English.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jefferson was not able to impose so rigid a Classicism on the new Federal capital
of Washington at its start, despite the efforts of various French and British engineers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>architects, and amateurs who participated in the competitions of 1792 for the President’s
House (White House) and for the Capitol and who worked on the latter during its first
decade of construction. The White House<a id="r24"></a><a href='#f24' class='c025'><sup>[24]</sup></a> as designed by the Irish architect James
Hoban (<i>c.</i> 1762-1831) was still quite in the earlier eighteenth-century Anglo-Palladian
manner, and Jefferson’s own project was based on Palladio’s Villa Rotonda. Neither
the English amateur William Thornton (1759-1828) and his professional assistant who
was also English, George Hadfield (<i>c.</i> 1764-1826), nor their French associate É.-S.
Hallet succeeded in giving the Capitol<a id="r25"></a><a href='#f25' class='c025'><sup>[25]</sup></a> a very up-to-date character (Plate <a href='#pl082a'>82<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Yet it
is these major edifices that still occupy two of the focal points in the Washington city
plan,<a id="r26"></a><a href='#f26' class='c025'><sup>[26]</sup></a> which was prepared by the French engineer P.-C. L’Enfant (1754-1825) before
his dismissal from public service in 1792.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Benjamin H. Latrobe (1764-1820), an English-born architect of German and
English training, who finally brought to America just before 1800, and shortly to
Washington, the highest professional standards of the day and a complete Romantic
Classical programme. Indeed, he almost succeeded in making Romantic Classicism the
official style in the United States for all time; at least it remained so down to the
Civil War in the sixties, and a later revival lasted, as regards public architecture in
Washington, from the 1900s to the 1930s (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>). A pupil of S. P. Cockerell,
Latrobe emigrated in 1796 and was soon assisting Jefferson on the final completion of
the Virginia State Capitol as well as undertaking the construction of canals as an engineer.
Not inappropriately Latrobe’s first important American building, the Bank of
Pennsylvania begun in 1798, was also an Ionic temple, but with an order that aspired to
be Greek. This Philadelphia bank included a great central hall whose saucer dome, visible
externally, made it a more complex and architectonic composition than the Richmond
Capitol. The flat lantern crowning the dome recalled, and may derive from, those over
Soane’s offices at the Bank of England. Characteristically, Latrobe at this very same time
was also building a country house, Sedgley, outside Philadelphia, with ‘Gothick’ detailing.
By 1803 he had taken charge of the construction of the Capitol, nominally under
Thornton, with whom he had continual rows. Most of the early interiors there were his,
notably those in the south wing, fine examples of Romantic Classicism with French as
well as English overtones; moreover he was still in charge of rebuilding them after the
burning of the Capitol in 1814 down to his forced resignation in 1817.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1805 Latrobe submitted alternative designs for the Catholic cathedral in Baltimore.
The Gothic design is one of the finest projects of the ‘Sublime’ or ‘High Romantic’
stage of the Gothic Revival; yet in its vast bare walls, carefully ordered geometry, and
dry detail it is also consonant with some of the basic ideals of Romantic Classicism. The
Classical design that was preferred and eventually built is perhaps less original; but
internally, at least, this is one of the finest ecclesiastical monuments of Romantic Classicism,
combining a rather Panthéon-like plan with segmental vaults of somewhat Soanic
character (Plate <a href='#pl005'>5</a>). The cathedral was largely completed by 1818. The portico, though
intended from the first, was added only in 1863, but the present bulbous terminations of
the western towers are not of Latrobe’s design.</p>

<p class='c010'>Near by in Baltimore the Unitarian Church of 1807 is by a Frenchman, Maximilien
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Godefroy (<i>c.</i> 1760-1833),<a id="r27"></a><a href='#f27' class='c025'><sup>[27]</sup></a> who was also responsible for the first Neo-Gothic ecclesiastical
structure of any consequence in North America, the chapel of St Mary’s
Seminary there, also of 1807. The Unitarian Church is a monument which might well
have risen in the Paris of the 1790s had the French Deists been addicted to building
churches. The triple arch in the plain stuccoed front below the pediment comes straight
from Ledoux’s <i>barrières</i>; the interior, unhappily remodelled in 1916, was originally a
dome on pendentives of the purest geometrical order. So also Godefroy’s Battle Monument
of 1814 also in Baltimore, with its Egyptian base, might easily have been erected
in Paris to honour some general prominent in Napoleon’s campaign on the Nile.<a id="r28"></a><a href='#f28' class='c025'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
Another Frenchman, J.-J. Ramée (1764-1842), active since the Revolution in Hamburg
and in Denmark, also came briefly to America. In 1813 he laid out Union College<a id="r29"></a><a href='#f29' class='c025'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
in Schenectady, N.Y., on a rather Ledolcian plan and began its construction before he
returned to Europe. His semicircle of buildings still crowns the hill—although two only
are original—and Ramée here initiated a tradition of college architecture as remote from
that of earlier American colleges, with their free-standing buildings set around a
‘campus’, as Wilkins’s Downing at Cambridge was from earlier English colleges.</p>

<p class='c010'>The French eventually departed leaving no line of descent; but Latrobe had a pupil,
the first professionally trained American in the field and, like Latrobe, almost as much
an engineer as an architect. By 1808 Robert Mills (1781-1855) was supervising for
Latrobe the new Bank of Philadelphia, Gothic (or at least ‘Gothick’) where his earlier
Bank of Pennsylvania had been Grecian, and also building on his own the Sansom Street
Baptist Church, a competent but not distinguished essay in Romantic Classicism. In the
same year another Latrobe pupil, William Strickland (1788-1854), designed for Philadelphia
a Gothick Masonic Hall; this was built in 1809-11, and later rebuilt, but
according to the original design, after a fire in 1819-20.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far more successful than either of these, if now overshadowed by the megalomaniac
Classicism of the twentieth-century Philadelphia Museum of Art by Horace Trumbauer
and others on the hill above, are the waterworks begun in 1811 on the banks of the
Schuylkill. These are probably but not certainly by Mills rather than by the engineer
Frederick Graff, whose name is signed to the drawings. These very utilitarian structures
are most characteristic of the beginnings of Romantic Classicism in America, where
Latrobe, Mills, and also Strickland were all three engineers as well as architects. Moreover,
it is evident that engineering considerations often influenced their approach to
architecture, just as architectural considerations gave visual distinction to much of their
engineering. Thus they may be compared with engineers like Telford and Rennie in
England as well as with the English architects of their day.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this so-called ‘Federal’ period, when Romantic Classicism centred in the Middle
Atlantic states thanks to Latrobe, Godefroy, Mills, and Strickland, the leading architect
outside this area, the Bostonian Charles Bulfinch (1763-1844), was a late-comer to
Romantic Classicism. His great public monument of the 1790s, the Massachusetts State
House in Boston, had been designed originally as early as 1787-8, and even as executed
in 1795-8 it derived principally from the Somerset House in London of Sir William
Chambers (1726-96) and in one interior from Wyatt. His Boston Court House of 1810
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>first showed evidence of a change in his style, notably in its smooth ashlar walls of cold
grey granite. That was a local material destined to lend particular distinction to the principal
Romantic Classical buildings of Boston from this time forward (see Chapter <a href='#ch05'>5</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Frenchmen who came to America at the end of the eighteenth century or in the
early 1800s (and shortly left again) could hardly import the French architecture of those
decades; on the one hand, they had all been trained before the Revolution, from which
most of them were in flight; on the other hand—and more consequently—there was
almost no later architecture for them to reflect. Between 1789 and 1806 French building
was at a standstill. Architects were mostly busy, if at all, with the decoration of
various revolutionary fêtes and the accommodation of new political agencies in old
structures.</p>

<p class='c010'>One major example of the accommodation of an older structure to a new purpose
deserves particular mention. In the years 1795-7 J.-P. de Gisors (1755-1828), E.-C.
Leconte (1762-1818), and the former’s brother A.-J.-B.-G. de Gisors (1762-1835)
built within the old Palais Bourbon the Salle des Cinq Cents, the legislative chamber of
the First Republic. This hemicycle, at least as rebuilt along much the original lines by
Joly in 1828-33, still serves as the Chamber of Deputies of the Fourth Republic. Such a
chamber, so different in plan from the college-chapel arrangement of the British House
of Commons with facing benches for Government and Opposition, is characteristically
Romantic Classical in form, but this form has unfortunately proved to be conducive to
an indefinite shading of multiple parties from right to left. The British model, suited to
two-party rule only, was rarely imitated; the French one has been rather frequently,
beginning with Latrobe’s House of Representatives in the Washington Capitol. Leaving
aside the apparent political effect of the plan—not so notable in Washington as
elsewhere—Gisors’s chamber seems to have been respectable if not especially distinguished.
Covered with a segmental half dome and a barrel vault, both top-lighted, the
smooth though rather richly decorated surfaces of the walls and the vaults made clear
the interesting geometrical form of the interior space. The prototype was the lecture
theatre of the École de Médecine in Paris erected in 1769-76 by Jacques Gondoin
(1737-1818), one of the most advanced interiors of its day.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was some private building in the Paris of the 1790s and early 1800s before public
building eventually revived at Napoleon’s fiat. Typical and partly extant is the Rue
des Colonnes, most probably by N.-A.-J. Vestier (1765-1816), although sometimes
attributed to Poyet, who may have had some urbanistic control. This has an open arcade
at the base carried on Greek Doric columns, here very modestly scaled, and cold flat
walls above that are almost without any detailing whatever. This Paris street, as much as
the arcaded ones of medieval and Renaissance Italy, may well have been the prototype
for Napoleon’s first and greatest urbanistic project, the work of his favourite architects
Charles Percier (1764-1838) and P.-F.-L. Fontaine (1762-1853). From his acquisition
of La Malmaison in 1799 he kept them busy remodelling the interiors of his successive
residences as First Consul and Emperor but rarely gave them new buildings to erect.
This extensive planning scheme includes the Rue de Castiglione, running south out of
the Place Vendôme, the Rue and Place des Pyramides, and the Rue de Rivoli facing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Tuileries Gardens. This last street was eventually extended to the east well beyond the
Louvre by Napoleon III. The opening of the Rue de Castiglione was ordered in 1801;
construction began the next year, and the execution of the rest went on, with long
interruptions, for more than half a century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Percier and Fontaine’s façades are characteristic of Romantic Classicism in their coldness
of detailing and their infinite repetition of the same formula; but their Italianism,
thin and dry though it is, recalls the plates in <i>Maisons et palais de Rome moderne</i>, which the
two architects had published in 1798 before their professional star had risen very high
(Plate <a href='#pl006b'>6<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). With Nash’s Cronkhill, although in a very different and even opposed spirit,
this scheme presages the international Renaissance Revival of the second quarter of the
century. The very effective high curved roofs, filling out completely the ‘envelope’
allowed by the Paris building code, were added in 1855; more conventional two-pitched
mansards were provided originally.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Empire mode, particularly as elaborated by Percier and Fontaine in the service
of the Emperor, was primarily a fashionable style for interiors, and found perhaps its
most characteristic expression in furniture, usually of dark mahogany with much ornate
decoration of a character resembling gold embroidery on uniforms. Such flat decorative
work is also found carved on exteriors, not only in France but wherever Napoleonic
influence penetrated. Indeed in furniture and interior design generally non-French work
is often of the highest quality, especially when executed for such clients as Napoleon’s
sister Caroline Murat at Naples.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet the character of French leadership in the arts had changed since the 1780s. The
architects at the end of the <i>ancien régime</i> had been truly revolutionary in their aesthetic
and their social ideals. Napoleon’s designers, almost like Hitler’s and Mussolini’s and
Stalin’s in our century, were flatterers and time-servers. Emulation of their work abroad
was chiefly a matter of following well-publicized fashion; creative French influence still
flowed, however, from men of the older generation now so largely forgotten at home.
Thus it was at this point that Ledoux’s projects became generally available to others,
thanks to his book published in 1804 and dedicated to Napoleon’s Russian ally of the
moment, Alexander I.</p>

<p class='c010'>Extensive building activity in Paris under Napoleon’s aegis began only in 1806, but
once it started there came a positive flood of projects in conscious emulation of Louis
XIV’s architectural campaigns. There was also the expectation that this activity would
absorb unemployment in the building trades. But Napoleon, like later dictators who
have initiated vast building projects, actually bit off a great deal more than he could
chew. He was, however, more fortunate than Mussolini and Hitler in that the regimes
which succeeded his in the decades between the First Empire and the Second were surprisingly
willing to carry his unfinished monuments to completion. Still later, his
nephew Napoleon III emulated him in an even more concerted programme of urbanism
and monumental construction carried out over nearly two decades in a very different
style—indeed in several (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Colonne de la Grande Armée, replacing the statue of Louis XV at the centre of
the Place Vendôme, is a properly symbolic monument of its epoch—first to be designed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of the many giant columns that would arise all across the Western world from Baltimore
to Petersburg within the next quarter century. Wilkins’s Nelson Pillar in Dublin,
actually completed before the Paris example, has already been mentioned. The column
in Paris is Trajanesque not Grecian, however, and was entirely executed with the bronze
of captured guns. It well represents the Imperial Roman megalomania already evident
in many projected memorials of the 1790s. Gondoin, its architect, with whom was
associated J.-B. Lepère (1761-1844), provides a real link with the past, since his
already-mentioned École de Médecine was one of the earliest major edifices in which
Romantic Classical ideals were carried beyond the transitional stage of Soufflot’s
Panthéon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even before the Colonne Vendôme was finished in 1810, a smaller and somewhat less
typical monument, but equally Roman and also the first of a considerable line, had been
completed by Percier and Fontaine. The Arc du Carrousel of 1806-8—once a gate to the
Tuileries from the Place du Carrousel, now unhappily floating in unconfined space—has
much of the daintiness and, in the use of coloured marbles, the polychromy of its architects’
contemporary palace interiors. Indeed, the richness of the detailing is far less characteristic
of Empire taste in architecture than are their façades near by in the Rue de
Rivoli (Plate <a href='#pl006b'>6<span class='fss'>B</span></a>); the Arc du Carrousel must have provided a rather fussy pedestal for
the superb Grecian horses stolen from St Mark’s in Venice that were originally mounted
upon it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far more satisfactorily symbolic of imperial aspiration is the enormous Arc de
Triomphe de l’Étoile, which looks down the entire length of the Champs Élysées today
to overwhelm its brother arch even at that great distance (Plate <a href='#pl007'>7</a>). J.-A. Raymond
(1742-1811), a pupil of Leroy, first received the commission; but with him was associated
J.-F.-T. Chalgrin (1739-1811), the master of the younger Gisors, who soon took
over and imposed his own astylar design. Chalgrin, like Gondoin, was an architect
already well established under the <i>ancien régime</i>. His major innovation had been the
reintroduction of the basilican plan<a id="r30"></a><a href='#f30' class='c025'><sup>[30]</sup></a> at Saint-Philippe-du-Roule in Paris in the 1760s,
henceforth one of the favourite models for Romantic Classical churches in France and
elsewhere on the Continent. Like many of the monuments of that earlier period by
Chalgrin’s contemporaries, his Arc de l’Étoile reverts less to Roman antiquity than to
certain aspects of the architecture of Louis XIV. Even its megalomaniac grandeur can be
matched, relatively at least, in the Porte St Denis in Paris built in the 1680s by François
Blondel, and it follows almost line for line the square proportions of that masterpiece.
The arch was slowly brought to completion after Chalgrin’s death, first by his pupil
L. Goust from 1811 to 1813 and from 1823 to 1830; then by Goust’s assistant, J.-N.
Huyot (1780-1840), advised by a commission that included François Debret (1777-1850),
Fontaine, and the younger Gisors; and finally from 1832 to 1837 by G.-A. Blouet
(1795-1853). It owes its unmistakably nineteenth-century character partly to the crisp,
hard quality of its imposts and entablatures and partly to the great Romantic figural
reliefs executed in 1833 by Rude, Etex, and Cortot. These take the place on the piers of
the more conventional trophy-hung obelisks on Blondel’s seventeenth-century arch. A
certain post-Empire quality derives from the plastic complexity of Blouet’s attic; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>on the whole the Arc de l’Étoile, if less original and less influential than Saint-Philippe-du-Roule,
is Chalgrin’s masterpiece and Napoleon’s finest memorial.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Place de la Concorde, projected by A.-J. Gabriel (1692-1782) at the end of
the Baroque Age, continued to lack, even after a half century and more, appropriate
monuments to terminate the cross axis. The building of a big church at the head of the
Rue Royale to close the vista between Gabriel’s two colonnaded ranges on the north
side of the square had bogged down well before the Revolution; across the river the
much earlier Palais Bourbon, set at an angle, was even more awkward than before, now
that the roof of the Salle des Cinq Cents rose above it. Since the amelioration of this
southern terminal required only a tall masking façade set at right angles to the axis,
this was promptly provided. Poyet in 1806-8 used the most obvious Romantic Classical
solution for such a problem, a high blank wall with a ten-columned temple portico at its
centre. The result is certainly an urbanistic success, if without any particular intrinsic
interest; the raising of the portico above a high range of steps ensured, for example, its
visibility from the square across the bridge. The form of the pediment was slightly
modified and the sculpture by Cortot added in 1837-41.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1761 Pierre Contant d’Ivry (1698-1777) and, after his death, G.-M. Couture
(1732-99) had made successive projects for a church dedicated to the Magdalen at the
head of the Rue Royale, the latter already proposing that it be surrounded by a Classical
peristyle. This structure, which was as yet barely begun, Napoleon now decided should
be not a church but a Temple de la Gloire—he reversed his decision in 1813 after the
Battle of Leipzig and the loss of Spain. For such a temple he understandably preferred,
in the competition held in 1806, neither the first nor the second premiated design,
both of church-like character, but one by Pierre Vignon (1763-1828) that proposed the
erection of an enormous Corinthian temple on a high Roman podium. Inside, a series
of square bays covered with domes on pendentives supported by giant Corinthian
columns provided a structural solution technically Byzantine but as imperially Roman in
scale and detailing as the exterior.</p>

<p class='c010'>Construction of the Madeleine, begun in 1807, dragged on interminably. J.-J.-M.
Huvé (1783-1852) succeeded Vignon as architect in 1828 and, like the Arc de l’Étoile,
the edifice was finally finished only under Louis Philippe in 1845. The interior has a
somewhat funereal solemnity, more characteristic of the post-Napoleonic regimes than
of the period of its initiation. The rather obvious temple form of the exterior is redeemed
by the superb siting, the really grand scale, and the rich pedimental sculpture by Lemaire.
Like Chalgrin’s arch, Vignon’s Madeleine has continued to provide a major monumental
nexus in the urbanism of Paris ever since.</p>

<p class='c010'>Also proposed in 1806 but not initiated until 1808 was the Bourse by A.-T. Brongniart
(1739-1813), another architect who had, like Gondoin and Chalgrin, made his
mark long before the Revolution (Plate <a href='#pl008b'>8<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Again a free-standing peripteral structure like
the Madeleine, the Bourse has suffered somewhat from its enlargement in 1902-3 by
J.-B.-F. Cavel (<i>c.</i> 1844-1905) and H.-T.-E. Eustache (1861-?). Nearly square originally
and unpedimented—and also set much closer to the ground—it must always have lacked
the monumental presence of the Madeleine. But the interior with its ranges of arcades,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>derived almost as directly from a Louis XIV monument—in this case the court of the
Invalides by Libéral Bruant—as Chalgrin’s arch was from that of Blondel, is very characteristic
of the sort of reiterative composition generally favoured by Romantic Classicism.
L.-H. Lebas (1782-1867) was associated with the elderly Brongniart from the start,
and after Brongniart’s death the building was finished in 1815 by E.-E. de Labarre
(1764-1833). Labarre was responsible also for the Colonne de la Grande Armée at
Boulogne; this was proposed in 1804 and begun in 1810, but, like so many Napoleonic
monuments, not finished until Louis Philippe took up its construction again in 1833.
It was finally completed by Marquise in 1844.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1799 a fire made it necessary to rebuild the Théâtre de l’Odéon; but the original
design of M.-J. Peyre (1730-88) and Charles de Wailly (1729-98), dating back to 1779,
was repeated in 1807 with little change, as was also the case in 1819 when it was rebuilt
again after another fire. This provides excellent evidence of the continuity of Romantic
Classical style in France before and after the Revolution (see Chapter <a href='#ch03'>3</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Napoleon had in mind the erection of various less monumental and more utilitarian
structures than the Bourse and the Odéon; some of these were started, and one or two
even finished, before the Empire came to an end. Behind one section of the façades in
the Rue de Rivoli an enormous and rather dull General Post Office was begun in 1810
and eventually completed to serve as the Ministry of Finance under Charles X in 1827.
Another ministry (Foreign Affairs) on the Quai d’Orsay was designed in 1810 by J.-C.
Bonnard (1765-1818) and even begun in 1814; this was eventually carried to completion
by Bonnard’s pupil Jacques Lacornée (1779-1856) in 1821-35. With its rich ordonnance
of columns and arches, Bonnard’s façade had an almost High Renaissance air, or so it
would appear from extant views of a structure long ago destroyed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Marché St Martin of 1811-16 by A.-M. Peyre (1770-1843), the Marché des
Carmes of 1813 by A.-L.-T. Vaudoyer (1756-1846), and the Marché St Germain of
1816-25 by J.-B. Blondel (1764-1825), with their clerestory lighting and open timber roofs,
are typical of the more practical side of Romantic Classicism.<a id="r31"></a><a href='#f31' class='c025'><sup>[31]</sup></a> The simple masonry
vocabulary of these Parisian markets, so straightforward and without Antique pretension,
was considered to be Italian (see Chapter <a href='#ch02'>2</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Napoleonic building flurry barely reached the provinces before its short course
was over. The theatre in Dijon, begun about 1805 by Jacques Célérier (1742-1814), may
be mentioned; but such plain square blocks with frontal porticoes could have been, and
were, built in almost precisely the same form thirty years before—for example Ledoux’s
theatre at Besançon of 1775-84. At Pontivy in Brittany, then called Napoléonville, the
younger Gisors built a Préfecture in 1809 and a Palace of Justice with associated prisons
two years later. A rather dull church, Saint-Vincent at Mâcon, repeating a model that
had been new at Saint-Philippe-du-Roule forty years earlier, was also erected by him
in 1810. The pair of front towers was a novelty suggested by an earlier project of
Lebas.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is quite characteristic of this period, so ready (as the French have been ever since) to
employ elderly architects and so content with stylistic innovations that dated from before
the Revolution, that Mathurin Crucy (1749-1826) rebuilt in 1808-12 the theatre in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Nantes—very like that at Dijon—in exactly the same form as it had originally been designed
by him in 1784-8; while he also finished in 1809-12 the Bourse and Tribunal de
Commerce there which he had begun in 1791, just after the Revolution started, with
no change in the original design. The setting of his theatre in the Place Graslin provided
by continuous ranges of five-storey houses is presumably contemporary; despite
the rather high roofs, the façades are notably crisp and smooth. The rusticated arcuation
of the lower storeys might make plausible a date in the 1780s, but the rather thin and
geometrically detailed iron balcony railings suggest rather the first or second decade of
the new century, when the theatre was rebuilt.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the imperial effort in France barely extended outside Paris except for the interior
alterations that Percier and Fontaine carried out in the royal châteaux at Versailles,
Compiègne, Saint-Cloud, and Fontainebleau—major examples of Empire decoration
but not of architecture—the emperor and his nominees left their mark on most of the
great cities of continental Europe. The Palazzo Serbelloni in the Corso Venezia, where
Napoleon stayed in Milan, had been built by Simone Cantoni (1736-1818) in 1794.
Similar to French work of the 1780s, it would probably have impressed the Emperor
as still quite up-to-date. He ordered in 1806 the laying out in Milan of the Forum
Bonaparte, according to the designs of Giannantonio Antolini (1754-1842), and the
erection of a conventionally Roman triumphal arch, the work of Luigi Cagnola (1762-1832?),
which was finally completed in 1838.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Rome the development of the Piazza del Popolo, like the Forum Bonaparte a work
of urbanism rather than of architecture, was based by Giuseppe Valadier (1762-1859),
an Italian despite his French name and ancestry, on a project he had made as early as
1794. This project was modified by him under the Empire to incorporate ‘corrections’
by the younger Gisors and L.-M. Berthault (1771?-1823). Execution of the project
actually began only in 1813 after Pope Pius VII returned from his Napoleonic captivity;
Valadier carried it forward to ultimate completion in 1831. Valadier’s Roman church
work, such as his new façade for San Pantaleone of 1806, just off the present-day Corso
Vittorio Emanuele, is mostly too dull to mention; his domestic work was somewhat
more interesting, but with little personal or even Italian flavour.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Naples Leconte, who had worked with the two Gisors on the Salle des Cinq Cents
in Paris, remodelled the San Carlo opera house in 1809 for Murat—it was, however,
refronted in 1810-12 and rebuilt in 1816-17 (see Chapter <a href='#ch03'>3</a>). In association with Antonio
de Simone, Leconte also decorated rooms in the Bourbon Palace at Caserta,<a id="r32"></a><a href='#f32' class='c025'><sup>[32]</sup></a> originally
built by Vanvitelli in 1752-74, for this Napoleonic brother-in-law. But the finest Empire
things in the area were the Sala di Marte and the Sala di Astrea there, which de
Simone, working alone, had begun to decorate slightly earlier in 1807 for Napoleon’s
brother Joseph Bonaparte (Plate <a href='#pl025'>25</a>). As with so many architectural projects of the brief
period of the Empire, it was left to a returning legitimate sovereign, in this case Ferdinand
I of the Two Sicilies, to finish the job. Unlike the greater part of Percier and Fontaine’s
work in the French palaces, these rooms at Caserta are interior architecture, not
just interior decoration, and fully worthy in their scale and their sumptuous materials
of the magnificent spaces, created almost half a century earlier by Vanvitelli, which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>occupy. This is the more remarkable as de Simone was really a decorator not an
architect.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Napoleonic emendation of the Piazza San Marco in Venice calls for little comment.
There Sansovino’s church of San Zimignan at the end was removed in 1807 and
replaced with a structure by G. M. Solis (1745-1823) more consonant with the fifteenth-
and sixteenth-century Procurazie by Buon and by Scamozzi along the sides. Solis’s
emendation finally completed, and not unworthily, this most magnificent piece of
urbanism in the form we now know it. La Fenice, the Venice opera-house, had been
rebuilt by Giannantonio Selva (1751-1819) in 1786-92; of his work, however, only the
rather dull façade remains. The exquisite Neo-Rococo interior is, rather surprisingly, of
the second quarter of the nineteenth century, being by the brothers Tommaso and G. B.
Meduna (1810-?), who restored the theatre after a fire in 1836.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ever since the fifteenth century Italian architects had worked much abroad, generally
bringing with them the latest stylistic developments. Now that day was largely over;
France, England, and very soon Germany were exporting taste as Italy had done for so
many previous centuries. After the Second World War her position as architectural
mentor began, at least, to revive again (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The employment of foreign architects by Russian Tsars was a well-established tradition
by the late eighteenth century;<a id="r33"></a><a href='#f33' class='c025'><sup>[33]</sup></a> most of them had been Italians, but one, Charles
Cameron (<i>c.</i> 1714-1812), who represents like Adam the transition from Academic to
Romantic Classicism, was Scottish.<a id="r34"></a><a href='#f34' class='c025'><sup>[34]</sup></a> There had also been a French designer of the
most original order working in Russia early in the eighteenth century, Nicholas Pineau
(1684-1754); he even formed his mature style there, initiating the ‘Pittoresque’ phase
of the Rococo well before he returned to France. Half a century later Catherine the
Great acquired the greater part of the drawings of Clérisseau, friend and mentor of
Adam and also of Jefferson. Catherine’s grandson, Alexander I, was so esteemed as a
liberal ruler in what had once been the most advanced of French architectural circles that
Ledoux, long left behind as a builder by Revolution and Empire, dedicated to him his
book on architecture in 1804, as has already been noted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after Alexander’s accession in 1801 he called on a less distinguished French
architect, Thomas de Thomon (1754-1813), to design the Petersburg Bourse<a id="r35"></a><a href='#f35' class='c025'><sup>[35]</sup></a> for
him; this structure, built in 1804-16, not Brongniart’s slightly later Bourse in Paris, is
the great, indeed almost the prime, monument of Romantic Classicism around 1800
(Plate #8A:pl008A). The blank pediment, rising from behind a colonnade, the great segmental
lunette lighting the interior, the flanking rostral columns, the smooth stucco so crisply
painted, all establish this as a perfect exemplar of this period, even though every idea in
it can be found in projects, if not in executed work, by Ledoux and Boullée dating from
before the Revolution. An even more precise prototype is provided by a project for a
‘Bourse Maritime’ by Pompon that won a second Grand Prix de Rome in 1798; this was
not published until 1806, after Thomon had begun his Bourse, but he was probably
familiar with it all the same. Not only is the Bourse exemplary in itself; Petersburg—already
a century old and with many vast Baroque palaces to its credit—rather than the
newly founded city of Washington on the other side of the western world, offers the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>finest urban entity of this brief period and of the following decades during which
Alexander and his brother Nicholas I continued for some thirty years major campaigns
of construction along Romantic Classical lines.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thomon’s chief Russian rival, Nikiforovich Voronikhin (1760-1814), was French-trained,
a pupil of de Wailly. His Kazan Cathedral at Petersburg of 1801-11 is still
rather Baroque in its obvious reminiscences of St Peter’s in Rome. But the Academy of
Mines, which he began ten years later, although somewhat heavy-handed in the way
Romantic Classicism tended to be, away from the great cultural centres, is almost as
exemplary as Thomon’s Bourse. More characteristically Russian in its incredible extension
and the great variety of its silhouette is the Admiralty<a id="r36"></a><a href='#f36' class='c025'><sup>[36]</sup></a> of 1806-15 by Adrian
Dimitrievich Zakharov (1761-1811). But the end façades successfully enlarged to monumental
scale the theme of the arched entrance to the pre-revolutionary Hôtel de Salm
in Paris by Pierre Rousseau (1751-1810). Altogether the Admiralty exceeded in quality
as well as in scale almost everything that Napoleon commanded to be built in France,
except perhaps the Arc de l’Étoile.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus Romantic Classicism before Waterloo had major representatives all the way
from Latrobe and Mills in America, the one a foreigner, the other a native, to Thomon
and his two native rivals in Russia; while the work of Leconte in Naples could once be
matched by that done by Ramée in Hamburg and Denmark before he went to America
and by the projects, at least, of Desprez in Sweden (see below). Other Frenchmen were
working throughout Napoleon’s realm and outside it as well; but the most distinguished
architect of this period hitherto unmentioned was a Dane, C. F. Hansen (1756-1845).
The design of his Palace of Justice of 1805-15 in the Nytorv in Copenhagen, with
its associated gaol, derives from the most advanced projects made by Frenchmen in the
earlier years of Romantic Classicism before 1800. The gaol and the arches of its courtyard
are more definitely Romantic than anything executed in France under Louis XVI,
for they specifically recall the ‘Prisons’ of Piranesi, those strange architectural dreams in
which the Baroque seems to become the Romantic before one’s very eyes. The gaol also
resembles a prison designed for Aix by Ledoux and owes a certain medieval flavour,
one must presume, to Hansen’s first- or second-hand knowledge of the projects of
Boullée.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still finer, because more homogeneous in conception if less pictorially Romantic, is
the principal church in Copenhagen, the Vor Frue Kirke in the Nørregade, designed in
1808-10 by Hansen and built over the years 1811-29. The severely plain tower above
the Greek Doric portico at the front illustrates the more primitivistic and Italianate aspects
of Romantic Classical theory—more precisely it might seem to derive from the
tower of a project for a slaughterhouse by F.-J. Belanger (1744-1818),<a id="r37"></a><a href='#f37' class='c025'><sup>[37]</sup></a> a pupil of
Leroy. The interior, eventually furnished with statues of Christ and the Twelve Apostles
by one of the greatest Romantic Classical sculptors, the Danish Thorwaldsen, raises its
ranges of Greek Doric columns to gallery level above a smooth arcuated base (Plate <a href='#pl004b'>4<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
These carry a coffered Roman barrel vault in a way that follows quite closely, although
with some change in the proportions, Boullée’s project for the Bibliothèque Royale.
Not the least successful and original feature of the exterior is the plain half-cylinder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of the half-domed apse broken only by a portal of almost Egyptian simplicity. But in
Copenhagen, with its old tradition of building in brick, the characteristic Romantic
Classical surfaces of smooth stucco seem alien and the curious pinky-brown that
Hansen’s buildings are painted is certainly a little gloomy today.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Sweden the Rome-trained French architect Desprez, whose projects of the 1780s
have been mentioned, was largely occupied not with building but with theatre settings;
however, there is at least the excellent Botanical Institute that he built in Uppsala,
designed in 1791 and completed in 1807, with its characteristic Greek Doric portico and
plain wall surfaces. More notable was his grandiose project, also of 1791, for the Haga
Slott in the form of a very long peripteral temple with an octastyle pedimented portico
projecting in the middle of the side. But Sweden saw no such monumental example of
Romantic Classicism carried to execution. Typical of actual production is the country
house at Stjamsund built in 1801 by C. F. Sundahl (1754-1831); this is more English
than French in character, indeed with its plain rectangular mass and central portico
almost literally Anglo-Palladian.</p>

<p class='c010'>Harassed and recurrently conquered or <i>gleichgeschaltet</i> though most of the German
states were in the Napoleonic Wars (while Sweden eventually received a Napoleonic
marshal as sovereign through the testament of her legitimate ruler) there was much
more building altogether in these years of the turn of the century in Germany than in
Sweden, or indeed in France, much of it of high quality. The frontispiece to Romantic
Classicism in Germany is the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, built in 1789-93 by K. G.
Langhans (1733-1808). Still somewhat attenuated and un-Grecian in its proportions,
this is the first of the Doric ceremonial gateways that were to be so characteristic of
Romantic Classicism everywhere and also one of the most complex and original in
composition. More ponderous and provincial is Langhans’s Potsdam theatre of 1795;
but the Stadttheater at Danzig of 1798-1801 by Held, the City Architect, a cube with a
Doric temple portico and a low saucer dome, follows a more Ledolcian paradigm.</p>

<p class='c010'>David Gilly (1748-1808) was a more advanced Berlin architect than the elderly
Langhans; but his best work of these years is the Viewegsches Haus in Brunswick of
1801-5 with its smooth stucco wall-planes, boldly incised ornament, and Greek Doric
porch. More elegantly French is another Brunswick house of this period, the free-standing
Villa Holland of 1805 by P. J. Krahe (1758-1840).</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilly would have been overshadowed by his son Friedrich (1771-1800) had the latter
lived, or so one must judge, not from his modest Mölter house in the Tiergartenstrasse
in Berlin of 1799, but from certain major projects. One, of 1797, is for a monument to
Frederick the Great which was widely and deeply influential for many years to come;
another, of 1800, is for a Prussian National Theatre, improving upon Ledoux’s at Besançon
as regards the interior and very original in its external massing. The monument
raised a Greek Doric temple on a tremendous substructure of the most abstract geometrical
character, surrounded it with obelisks, and set the whole in a vast open space,
unconfined but—as it were—defined by subsidiary structures of very fresh and varied
design (Plate <a href='#pl009a'>9<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The handsome gateway to the square seems to provide evidence of
Gilly’s familiarity with such a highly personal work of Soane as his entrance arch at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Tyringham (Plate <a href='#pl006a'>6<span class='fss'>A</span></a>); however, the general tone of somewhat funereal grandeur recalls
rather the monumental projects of Ledoux, Boullée, and the younger men of
France who designed so much and built so little in this decade. Other contemporary
Berlin architects, such as Heinrich Gentz (1766-1801), who built the old Mint in 1798-1800,
and Friedrich Becherer (1746-1823), who built the Exchange in 1801, while up-to-date
stylistically, were much less accomplished than Friedrich Gilly. His artistic heir was
his fellow pupil Schinkel, whose architectural career really began in 1816 (see Chapter <a href='#ch02'>2</a>).</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 1. Friedrich Weinbrenner: Karlsruhe, Marktplatz, 1804-24, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Baden architect Friedrich Weinbrenner (1766-1826) was already active in Strasbourg
in the 1790s, and his monument of 1800 to General Desaix on the Île des Épis,
Bas-Rhin, is so French in every way that it properly finds a place in the official publication
by Gourlier and others of the public works of France in these years. Returning to
Karlsruhe, Weinbrenner began perhaps the most productive architectural career of any
German of his generation, transforming the Baden capital into a Romantic Classical
city somewhat less monumental, but more coherently exemplary, than Petersburg. His
own house there dated from 1801 and his Ettlinger Gate from 1803. In 1804 he began
work on the Marktplatz there, basing himself, however, on earlier projects that he had
made in 1790 and in 1797 (Plate <a href='#pl010a'>10<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). A Baroque scheme exists on paper for this square,
closing it in with continuous façades and curving them round the ends. Weinbrenner’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>characteristically Romantic Classical approach to the design of a square is quite different,
similar to if somewhat less open than Friedrich Gilly’s intended setting for the Frederick
the Great Monument (Figure <a href='#i017'>1</a>). Two balancing but not identical buildings, each more
or less isolated, face each other across the centre of the oblong space. The other less important
structures appear as separate blocks. Their relative geometrical purity is underlined
by the even purer form of the plain pyramidal monument erected in the centre in
1823. Such had for some time provided favourite decorations in Romantic gardens, but
this was the first to be used as a focal accent in place of an arch, a column, or an obelisk.
The City Hall on one side, with the associated Lyceum, was begun in 1804 and completed
some twenty years later. The temple-like Evangelical Church which faces the
City Hall was built in 1807-16. Something of the grand scale of the Corinthian portico
on the front of the church is carried over into the interior, where two tiers of galleries
run along the sides behind giant Corinthian nave colonnades. In the circular Rondellplatz,
punctuated eventually by an obelisk in the centre, there rose in 1805-13 Weinbrenner’s
Markgräfliches Palais, its portico set against the concave quadrant of the front.
His domed Catholic church of 1808-17 was unfortunately entirely rebuilt in 1880-3.</p>

<p class='c010'>Similar to Weinbrenner’s Rondellplatz is the Karolinenplatz in Munich, laid out by
Karl von Fischer (1782-1820) in 1808. But this was originally even more Romantic
Classical in disposition, since the individual houses were all discrete blocks set in the segments
between the entering streets. The 106-foot obelisk in the centre here was erected
in 1833 by Leo von Klenze (1784-1864). Fischer’s National Theatre in the Max-Josephsplatz
in Munich, projected in 1810 and built in 1811-18—and later rebuilt by
Klenze according to the original design after a fire in 1823—is a quite conventional monument
of its day dominated by a great temple portico. Though not very crisp in its proportions,
this theatre has real presence, particularly in relation to the less boldly scaled
Renaissance Revival buildings by Klenze, the Königsbau of 1826 and the Hauptpostamt
of ten years later, which flank it on the sides of the square.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not to extend unduly this catalogue of German work of the very opening years of the
nineteenth century, one may conclude with mention of the Women’s Prison in Würzburg
by Peter Speeth (1772-1831) built in 1809-10. In this, much of the boldness of design
of the French prison projects of Ledoux and Boullée was happily realized, if at a rather
modest scale (Plate <a href='#pl017b'>17<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Speeth later proceeded to Russia, but what he did there is a
mystery.</p>

<p class='c010'>Austrian production was rather limited and on the whole undistinguished in this
period. The extant façade by Franz Jäger (1743-1809) of the Theater an der Wien of 1797-1801
off the Linke Wienzeile in Vienna has a delicacy that is more <i>style Louis XVI</i> than
Romantic Classical. Neither the Palais Rasumofsky at 23-25 Rasumofskygasse in Vienna
of 1806-7, built by Louis Joseph von Montoyer (<i>c.</i> 1749-1811) for Beethoven’s patron,
nor his Albertina of 1800-4 on the Augustinerbastei has much character. There is
equally little to be said for the Palais Palffy of 1809 at 3 Wallnerstrasse by the other leading
Viennese architect of the day, Karl von Moreau (1758-1841). Despite his French
name, Montoyer was a Hapsburg subject from the Walloon provinces; Moreau’s origin
is uncertain, but he is reputed to have been trained, if not born, in France. If he was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>French, Austria would be one of the few countries where no French architect worked in
this period.</p>

<p class='c010'>A certain sort of primacy must certainly be given to France in this period, although
less definitely than in the decades 1750-90, because the French became the educators of
the world in architecture and the codifiers of style once a new post-Baroque style had
been created. Among Napoleon’s new institutional establishments was the École Polytechnique.
Here architecture was taught by Durand, a pupil of Boullée, under the Empire
and the following Restoration. His <i>Précis des leçons</i> became a sort of Bible of later
Romantic Classicism throughout his lifetime and even beyond. Above all in Germany,
the instruction of Durand provided the link between the innovations of the creative decades
before the Revolution in France and a new generation of architects who matured
just in time to take over the building activities of the kingdoms which rose from the
ruins of Napoleon’s empire. We may well precede any description of the achievements
of Romantic Classicism after 1810 with some consideration of Durand’s treatise.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>From</span> the time of Louis XIV France had been unique in possessing a highly organized
system of architectural education. Under the aegis of the Académie, students were prepared
for professional practice in a way all but unknown elsewhere. To crown their
formal training came the opportunity, determined by competition, for the ablest to
spend several years of further study as <i>pensionnaires</i> in Rome. The revolutionary years of
the 1790s disrupted temporarily the French pattern of architectural education and recurrent
wars cut off access to Rome. The Empire, however, early re-established the pattern
of higher professional education with only slight and nominal differences. From 1806
on, moreover, the competition projects for the Prix de Rome, including those from as
far back as 1791, were handsomely published in a series of volumes.<a id="r38"></a><a href='#f38' class='c025'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Thus the whole
international world of architecture could henceforth have ready access to the visual results
of official French training in architecture, if not to the actual discipline of the
Parisian ateliers.</p>
<p class='c010'>Napoleon, as an ex-ordnance officer, felt more sympathy with engineers than with
architects; hence he established a new École Polytechnique, where architecture was included
in the curriculum along with various sciences and technics. J.-N.-L. Durand
(1760-1834), the new school’s professor of architecture, published his <i>Précis des leçons
d’architecture données à l’École Polytechnique</i> in two volumes in 1802-5, thus making a
fairly complete presentation of the content of French architectural education generally
available.<a id="r39"></a><a href='#f39' class='c025'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Recurrent issues of this work down to 1840, of which at least one appeared
outside France—in Belgium—allowed this popular treatise to become a sort of bible of
Romantic Classicism that retained international authority for a generation and more.</p>

<p class='c010'>Durand was a pupil of Boullée; but both the text and the plates of his book indicate
his capacity for synthesizing and systematizing the diverse strands of theory and practice
that had developed in France in the previous forty years. Because of his temperament
and background, and <i>a fortiori</i> because he was teaching not in an art academy but in a
technical school, Durand is doubtless to be classed within his generation as a proponent
of structural rationalism. But he was a much more eclectic one than Soufflot’s disciple
Rondelet, from 1795 professor at the École Centrale des Travaux Publics and author of
the major treatise on building construction of the period.<a id="r40"></a><a href='#f40' class='c025'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Durand’s lessons incorporated
many other aspects of Romantic Classicism, from the pure Classical Revivalism of one
wing of the academic world to an eclectic interest in Renaissance and even, like his
master Boullée, in certain medieval modes; only the recondite symbolism of Ledoux is
absent. In general, one feels in Durand’s case, as always with the second generation of an
artistic movement, some loss of intensity at various points where the awkward edges of
opposed sources of inspiration were clipped to allow their coherent codification.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>After a theoretical introduction concerning the goal of architecture, its structural
means, and the general principles to be derived therefrom, Durand deals as a convinced
‘constructor’ with various materials and their proper employment before treating of
specific forms and their combination. Only in the second part of his work, concerned
with ways of combining architectural elements, do the visual results of his theories become
fully evident. There he presents in plan and in elevation various structural systems
from trabeated colonnades of Greek and Roman inspiration to arcuated and vaulted
forms of Renaissance or even round-arched medieval character. Among his specific
examples, ‘vertical combinations’ of fifteenth- or sixteenth-century elements outnumber
the strictly Classical paradigms (Figure <a href='#i021'>2</a>); whole plates, moreover, are given
to schemes that are not only generically Italianate, but of Early Christian, Romanesque,
or even Gothic, rather than Renaissance, inspiration. Common to most of his examples
is the insistent repetition of elements, both horizontally and vertically, and most characteristic
is his interest in the varied skylines that central and corner towers can provide,
as also in the incorporation of voids in architectural compositions in the form of
loggias and pergolas. More monumental façades fronted by temple porticoes are in a
minority, although colonnades are frequent enough in his presentation of such specific
features as porches, vestibules, halls, galleries, and central spaces. Here are to be found
most of the detailed formulas—almost all derived from Boullée and from the Grand
Prix projects of the previous decade—which the next generation of architects would
follow again and again throughout most of the western world.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In his second volume Durand turns from a consideration of architecture
in terms of structural elements to a notably systematic presentation
of buildings in terms of their varying functions. First he deals with
urbanistic features, including not only bridges, streets, and squares,
but also such supposedly essential elements of the ideal classicizing
city as triumphal arches and tombs. A second section considers temples
(not churches, it is amusing to note), palaces, treasuries, law
courts, town halls, colleges, libraries, museums, observatories,
lighthouses, markets, exchanges, custom houses, exhibition buildings,
theatres, baths, hospitals, prisons, and barracks. Here were all the
individual structures of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the model Napoleonic city, of which Napoleon had time to build
so few but of which the next decades in France and abroad were to see
so many executed by Durand’s pupils and other emulators of his ideals.</p>

<p class='c010'>For less representational edifices, from town halls and markets to
prisons and barracks, Durand’s utilitarianism led him to substitute
for colonnades and domes plain walls broken by ranges of arcuated
openings, sometimes of <i>quattrocento</i> or Roman-aqueduct character
but as often of vaguely medieval inspiration. For nearly a half
century such paradigms were very frequently followed, not only in
France but even more in other countries, as Classicism continued to
grow more Romantic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor were the designs for houses that Durand provided in the final
section of his book entirely uninfluential.<a id="r41"></a><a href='#f41' class='c025'><sup>[41]</sup></a> However, there were
fewer of these, and the inspiration of far more executed work of the
next forty or fifty years can be traced to his paradigms for public
monuments than to his prescriptions for private dwellings. Indeed,
Romantic Classicism is a predominantly public style, and its
utilitarianism is of the State rather than of the private individual.
However, the opposing current of the Picturesque, reflected in
Durand’s book only in his concern for the ‘employment of the objects
of nature in the composition of edifices’ (by which he meant hardly
more than Italianate fountains and even more Italianate vine-hung
loggias), provided amply for the individual
(see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>It might seem natural to continue from this discussion of Durand’s treatise with some
account of the executed architecture of France during the final years of the Empire after
1810, under the last Bourbons, and under Louis Philippe. Actually, however, the most
concrete examples of Durand’s influence, and certainly the finest Durandesque monuments,
are to be found not in France but in Germany and Denmark.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the time of Napoleon, French influence on German architecture was a
very old story. More and more French architects were employed by
German princes as the eighteenth century proceeded, and by 1800 there
were few German centres without examples of their work. As we have
seen in the previous chapter, moreover, the work of various German
architects in the 1790s and the early 1800s, whether or not they had
actually studied or even travelled in France, showed their devotion to
the early ideals of Romantic Classicism. Such men as K. G. Langhans
and David Gilly in Berlin, Fischer in Munich, or Weinbrenner in
Karlsruhe had no Napoleon to employ them; but they were happier than
his architects in seeing their major works brought to relatively early
completion. At Karlsruhe Weinbrenner’s comprehensive projects for the
new quarters of the town continued to go forward down to his death in
1826. By that time his City Hall had finally been finished, and street
after street of modest houses filled out the pattern of a coherent
Romantic Classical city.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Karlsruhe Marktplatz stands as one of the happiest ensembles of
the early nineteenth century, happy not alone because Weinbrenner, who
first conceived it, was able to carry it to final completion before
architectural fashions had begun to change, but even more because that
first conception dated back to the most vigorous period of the
architectural revolution in Germany and was not notably diluted by the
more pedestrian standards of later days (Plate <a href='#pl010a'>10<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
In detail, perhaps, the original designs for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>individual buildings were bolder; but the ideal of a public square,
not walled in in the Baroque way but defined by discrete blocks,
balanced but not identical, and focused by the eye-catching diagonals
of the central pyramid, a geometric shape as pure as the cube or the
sphere yet also an established formal symbol and a subtle memory of
the Egyptian past, was fully realized (Figure <a href='#i017'>1</a>). Outside the
Marktplatz, except perhaps in the Rondellplatz with its central
obelisk, Weinbrenner’s work is more provincial though in a very
distinguished way. Here and there, moreover, a pointed arch or a touch
of asymmetry showed his early response to the contemporary currents of
the Picturesque.</p>

<p class='c010'>Weinbrenner’s death in 1826 and the succession as State architect of
Baden of his pupil Heinrich Hübsch (1795-1863) provides a natural
break in the Romantic Classical story at just that point when the rise
of new ideals began to make the more Classical side of Romantic
Classicism out of date—in 1828 Hübsch himself published a
characteristic essay, <i>In welchem Styl sollen wir bauen?</i>, a
question to which the answers were increasingly various, and rarely
the Classical style. Elsewhere in Germany, and notably in Bavaria,
where the Wittelsbachs, raised to kingship while in alliance with
Napoleon, were also the most culturally ambitious rulers of a
post-Napoleonic state, there is no such sharp break. Leo von Klenze,
born in 1784 in Hildesheim, lived until 1864; his Munich Propylaeon,
completed only the year before his death and begun as late as 1846, is
by no means the least Grecian of his works. Klenze (he was ennobled by
his royal patron) had studied in Paris under the Empire not only under
Durand at the École Polytechnique but also with Percier. In 1805 he
had visited the other two main sources of up-to-date architectural
inspiration, Italy with its Classical ruins and its Renaissance
palaces, and England with its own early version of Romantic Classicism
and its various illustrations of the Picturesque. In 1808 Napoleon’s
brother Jerome, then King of Westphalia, who was already employing
A.-H.-V. Grandjean de Montigny (1776-1850), had made the
twenty-four-year-old Paris-trained German his court architect; in 1814
Maximilian I called him to Munich.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1816 Klenze began his first major construction, the Munich Glyptothek, a characteristic
and externally somewhat dull sculpture gallery. This is dominated in the established
French way by a tall temple portico in the centre, and the blank walls at either
side are relieved, none too happily, by aedicular niches. But if the exterior (which survived
the blitz) is conventional enough the interiors, completed in 1830 and originally
filled—among other magnificent antiquities—with the sculpture from the temple at
Aegina as repaired and installed by Thorwaldsen, made it one of the finest productions
of the great early age of museum-building as long as they existed (Plate <a href='#pl009b'>9<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The plan,
with a range of top-lit galleries around a court, was generically Durandesque in its
square modularity; the sections followed almost line for line one of Durand’s paradigms
for art galleries (Figure <a href='#i024'>3</a>). The sumptuous decoration of the vaults and the superb
sculpture so handsomely arranged by Thorwaldsen provided a mixture of periods—real
fifth-century Greek and Empire—distressing to purists but wonderfully symptomatic of
the ideals of the age.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Glyptothek was the first building erected in the Königsplatz, a very typical
Romantic Classical urbanistic entity. Faced by an even more completely columniated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>picture gallery, built by G. F. Ziebland (1800-73) in 1838-48, with Klenze’s Propylaeon
of 1846-63 forming the far side of the square, the Königsplatz has all the coldness and
barrenness which Weinbrenner happily avoided in his Marktplatz; by the time of its
completion this must have seemed very out of date, not least to Klenze himself. But as
the Propylaeon indicates, Klenze never eschewed trabeated Classicism, however much
his best later work belongs to—indeed to a considerable extent actually initiates—the
Renaissance Revival.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>His Walhalla<a id="r42"></a><a href='#f42' class='c025'><sup>[42]</sup></a> near Regensburg, built in 1831-42 but based on designs prepared a decade
or more earlier, is the most grandly sited of all the copies of Greek and Roman
temples which succeeded in the first half of the nineteenth century Jefferson’s initial
large-scale example at Richmond, Virginia. Like the finest ancient Greek temples, it is
raised high on a hill—that is actually what is most truly Classical about it, as it is also,
paradoxically, what may today seem most specifically Romantic
(Plate <a href='#pl016a'>16<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But the tremendous substructure of staircases
and terraces, derived from Friedrich Gilly’s project for the monument
to Frederick the Great (Plate <a href='#pl009a'>9<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), could belong to
no other period than this.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the thirties Klenze, who had already visited Greece in 1823-4 before the establishment
of a Wittelsbach monarchy gave employment to Bavarian architects there, was
called to Petersburg. There, in 1839-49, rose his Hermitage Museum. The elaborate detailing
of this, however Grecian it may be in intention, reflects the growing taste for
elaboration in the second quarter of the century as his other Classical works do not.
Still later, though not as late as the Propylaeon, is the Munich Ruhmeshalle of 1843-53,
a
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped
Doric stoa which provides in the Hellenistic way a setting for a giant statue
of Bavaria by Schwanthaler. This is dull, and still in the old-established Grecian mode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of the earlier years of the century. More characteristically, however, Klenze left all that
behind him even before 1825, when Maximilian I was succeeded by Ludwig I.</p>

<p class='c010'>Museums are the most typical monuments of Romantic Classicism, as a whole range
of them<a id="r43"></a><a href='#f43' class='c025'><sup>[43]</sup></a> from the Museo Pio-Clementino by Michelangelo Simonetti (1724-81) at the
Vatican in Rome of 1769-74 down at least to the Neuere Pinakothek in Munich of
1846-53 by August von Voit (1801-71) sufficiently illustrate. The two most purely
Grecian examples, Smirke’s British Museum in London (Plate <a href='#pl033'>33</a>) and Schinkel’s
Neues (later Altes) Museum in Berlin (Plate <a href='#pl013'>13</a>), were not yet designed when Klenze
first turned his attention in the years 1822-5 to planning a gallery for paintings at
Munich. Begun in 1826 and completed in 1833, the Pinakothek (later Ältere Pinakothek)
might be considered the earliest monumental example of revived High Renaissance
design. Yet there is little about it that cannot be matched in published French Grand
Prix projects or in the plates of Durand; Bonnard’s ministry on the Quai d’Orsay in
Paris, moreover, must have been rather similar. The Pinakothek was largely destroyed
in the Second World War, but has now been rebuilt according to Klenze’s original
design, except for the ceiling decorations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another building by Klenze, the Königsbau section of the Royal palace in Munich,
fronting on the Max-Josephplatz at right angles to Fischer’s theatre, is a more attractive
early example of the Renaissance Revival. Begun in the same year 1826 as the Ältere
Pinakothek, it was completed in 1833. The façade follows closely that of the Pitti Palace
as extended in the seventeenth century, but carries the pilasters of Alberti’s Rucellai
Palace, and in designing it Klenze must have drawn heavily on the <i>Architecture toscane</i>
of Grandjean de Montigny.<a id="r44"></a><a href='#f44' class='c025'><sup>[44]</sup></a> The planning inside is curiously free and asymmetrical considering
the total regularity of the fenestration, but then little trace of the original Pitti
plan had survived to be followed by an imitator.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1836 Klenze completed this square, so characteristic a product of two generations
of Romantic Classicism, by facing the eighteenth-century Palais Törring on the other
side from the Königsbau with a <i>quattrocento</i> arcade in order to provide a monumental
and harmonious Central Post Office. Another earlier square, the Odeonsplatz, with
Klenze’s Leuchtenberg Palais of 1819, his matching Odeon completed in 1828, and a
range of shops of 1822, also by him, on the other side of the Ludwigstrasse, has almost as
much Italian Renaissance feeling but is less derivatively Tuscan. It follows rather the
work of his master Percier in Paris under the Empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The increasing eclecticism of Romantic Classical architects is well illustrated by the
fact that the Court Church<a id="r45"></a><a href='#f45' class='c025'><sup>[45]</sup></a> attached to the palace at the rear was built by Klenze in the
same years as the Königsbau, 1826-37. This is covered by a series of domes on pendentives,
derived presumably from the Madeleine in Paris but detailed to suggest, as
Vignon’s do not, the ultimately Byzantine origin of the structural form; the immediate
prototype, however, was probably one of Schinkel’s projects for the Werder Church
in Berlin (see below).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the creation of the principal street of Ludwigian Munich, the Ludwigstrasse, a
rival of Klenze’s, Friedrich von Gärtner (1792-1847), like Klenze ennobled by his
sovereign, played a more important role. Born in Coblenz, Gärtner studied first at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Munich Academy, where he was later to be professor of architecture and, from 1841,
director. After his studies in Munich, he travelled in France, Italy, Holland, and England,
although he had no formal foreign training such as Klenze’s. Gärtner’s first major
work, destined by its tall twin towers to dominate the long and rather monotonous
perspective of the Ludwigstrasse, was the Ludwigskirche built in 1829-40 (Plate <a href='#pl010b'>10<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
If Klenze’s Court Church was Byzantinesque, Gärtner’s church was Romanesquoid,
though still in a rather Durandesque way. Even more Durandesque, and very much
finer, is the long façade of Gärtner’s State Library next door, which was built in 1831-40
(Plate <a href='#pl010b'>10<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Here the tawny tones of the brick and terracotta, as much as the slightly
medievalizing detail of the arcuated front, give evidence of the Romantic rejection of
the monochromy typical of the Greek Revival. But if this façade is warm in colour it
could hardly be colder in design, throwing into happy relief the richer <i>ordonnance</i> of
Klenze’s nearby War Office of 1824-6 with its rusticated arches and low wings (Figure <a href='#i026'>4</a>).</p>

<div id='i026'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 4. Leo von Klenze: Munich, War Office, 1824-6, elevation</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Rounding out the Ludwigstrasse are many other consonant structures. By Klenze is
the Herzog Max Palais of 1826-30 on the right; by Gärtner the Blindeninstitut of
1834-8, farther down opposite the Ludwigskirche, and the University of 1834-40 together
with the Max Joseph Stift that complete the terminal square. There stands also
the inharmoniously Roman Siegestor of 1843-50 which is, rather surprisingly, also by
Gärtner. Far more appropriate, if equally unoriginal, is his Feldherrenhalle of 1841-4
at the other end of the street above the Odeonsplatz, a close copy of the fourteenth-century
Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence. The whole area constitutes what is perhaps the
finest, or at least the most coherent, range of streets and squares of the later and more
eclectic phase of Romantic Classicism. This exceeds in extent, though not in quality,
Weinbrenner’s Marktplatz in Karlsruhe of the preceding quarter century. This brilliant
Munich period came to an end on Ludwig I’s abdication in 1848; his successor Maximilian
II’s attempt to find a ‘new style’ for his Maximilianstrasse in the next decade was a
dismal fiasco, for this ‘new style’ as applied by Friedrich Bürklein (1813-73), a pupil
of Gärtner, in building up the new street in 1852-9 proved to be merely a fussy and
muddled approach to the English Perpendicular, already employed with more success by
Bürklein’s master.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Before his death, the year before Maximilian II’s accession, Gärtner had all but completed
the Wittelsbach Palace. This he had begun in 1843 using a very Durandesque
version of English Tudor executed in red brick. Red brick also characterizes another
example of contemporary eclecticism, the Bonifazius Basilika of 1835-40 by Ziebland.
This was designed, as its name implies, in a Romantic Classical version of the Early
Christian; but it is much less Roman in detail than the great French and Italian churches
of the period of this generic basilican order (see Chapter <a href='#ch03'>3</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Most of these variant aspects of later Romantic Classicism in Munich, whether Early
Christian, Byzantine, Romanesque, Italian Gothic, or <i>quattrocento</i> in inspiration, are
also examples of what was called at this time in Germany the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>.<a id="r46"></a><a href='#f46' class='c025'><sup>[46]</sup></a> A large and
prominent example in Munich, late enough to illustrate how this special mode of
Romantic Classicism deteriorated after the mid century, was Bürklein’s railway station
built in 1857-60. The whole station has now been largely but not entirely destroyed by
bombing; originally it had a handsome shed with very heavy arched principals of
timber.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although the mode may be readily paralleled in other North European countries,
the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> is peculiarly German. It was, indeed, the favourite mode of the
thirties and forties in most German states; certainly it is comparable in local importance
to the mature Gothic Revival of these decades in England as the German Neo-Gothic is
not (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>). Deriving from the more utilitarian arcuated models provided by
Durand (and ultimately from the projects of his master Boullée and other French architects
of the 1780s), the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> is still a phase of Romantic Classicism even if in it
the Romantic element has risen close to dominance. But in its rigidity of composition,
repetition of identical elements, and emphasis on direct structural expression it is wholly
in the line of the earlier and more Classical rationalism.</p>

<p class='c010'>The changing taste of these decades usually demanded ever more and busier detail.
Rivalry with the archaeological pretensions of the Greek Revival, moreover, called for
a certain parade of stylistic erudition. But the archaeological sources drawn upon were
very various and to varying degrees effectively documented. From the Early Christian
to the <i>quattrocento</i>, most of them were more or less Italianate. However, there were
some architects who succeeded—like Gärtner at the Wittelsbach Palace—in using
pointed-arched precedent in a characteristically <i>Rundbogenstil</i> way; others elaborated
their detail with real originality rather than adhering closely to any past precedent
at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>On its <i>quattrocento</i> side the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> was perhaps
most notably represented in Germany by the Johanneum in Hamburg of
1836-9 (completely destroyed in the Second World War), a large
building surrounding three sides of a court and incorporating two
schools and a library (Plate <a href='#pl011b'>11<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This was by C. L.
Wimmel (1786-1845), like Hübsch a pupil of Weinbrenner, and F. G. J.
Forsmann (1795-1878). This particular <i>Rundbogenstil</i> work can
also be classified as belonging, like Klenze’s Königsbau, to the
international Renaissance Revival of which Hamburg was rather a
centre. For example, the extant Exchange there of 1836-41 by these
same architects is of richer and more High Renaissance character and
not at all <i>Rundbogenstil</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Many houses in Hamburg built by Gottfried Semper (1803-79), Alexis de Chateauneuf
(1799-1853), who had studied in Paris, and others in the forties were of elegant
Early Renaissance design—one by the former even having <i>sgraffiti</i> on the walls—more
like Klenze’s row of shops in the Odeonsplatz. The Rücker-Jenisch house of 1845 by the
Swiss-born Auguste de Meuron (1813-98), a pupil of the same French architect,
A.-F.-R. Leclerc, as de Chateauneuf, was certainly not <i>Rundbogenstil</i> but rather a version
of the Travellers’ Club in London. Thus it followed, in this anglicizing city, an epoch-making
model by Charles Barry that dates from fifteen years earlier (see Chapter <a href='#ch04'>4</a>).
However, de Chateauneuf’s Alster Arcade beside the waters of the Kleine Alster and
his red brick Alte Post (now the Welt-Wirtschafts-Archiv) of 1845-7 in the Poststrasse
are both prominent and excellent examples of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> of this period in Hamburg,
the latter being slightly Gothic in its detailing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The work of Hübsch, Weinbrenner’s successor as State architect in Baden, despite his
very serious archaeological study of Early Christian and Romanesque architecture,<a id="r47"></a><a href='#f47' class='c025'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
falls somewhere between Gärtner’s Ludwigskirche and Ziebland’s Bonifazius Basilika
without achieving either the crisply Durandesque quality of the one or the relative
archaeological plausibility of the other. In his civil buildings, such as the very simple
Ministry of Finance designed in 1827 and built in 1829-33, the more ornate Technische
Hochschule of 1832-6, the Art Gallery of 1840-9, and the Theatre of 1851-3, all
in Karlsruhe, very considerable originality of composition was more and more confused
as he grew older by the fussy elaboration of the terracotta ornamentation.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his later work Hübsch frequently used not the round but the segmental arch—a
highly rational form with brick masonry—and was usually somewhat happier than the
Bavarians in handling the tawny tonalities of brick and terracotta which so generally
replaced the pale monochromy of the Greek Revival in the thirties and forties. A minor
but especially fine example of his most personal manner is the Trinkhalle of 1840 at
Baden-Baden (Plate <a href='#pl011a'>11<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), rather better suited in its festive spirit to a watering-place
than the Classical severity of Weinbrenner’s Kurhaus there of 1821-3. Hübsch’s churches
are naturally more archaeological in character and definitely more Romanesquoid than
<i>Rundbogenstil</i>. Those at Freiburg (1829-38), Bulach (1834-7), and Rottenburg (1834) are
typical. The <i>Rundbogenstil</i> railway stations of another Baden architect, Friedrich Eisenlohr
(1804-55), at Karlsruhe (1842) and Freiburg precede Bürklein’s in Munich in date
and are rather superior to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Rundbogenstil</i> was particularly dominant in the southern German states, overflowing
also into Switzerland, where the Federal Palace in Berne, built in 1851-7 by
Friedrich Studer (1817-70), is a particularly extensive and nobly sited example. It was,
however, in Prussia in the north of Germany that the greatest architect who worked in
this mode was active, and he owes his reputation largely to his Grecian work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Karl Friedrich von Schinkel, the only architect of the first half of the nineteenth century
who can be compared in stature with the English Soane, was the great international
master of two successive phases of Romantic Classicism, first of the programmatic
Greek Revival, with which the post-Napoleonic period began almost everywhere in the
second decade of the century, and then of the more eclectic phase that followed. Born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in 1781, a generation later than Soane, Schinkel’s serious architectural production began
only in 1816. His relatively early death in 1841 truncated his career; but his pupils and
his spirit dominated Prussian, and indeed most of German, architecture for another
score of years and more.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat as the long-lived Titian stood to the short-lived Giorgione stood Schinkel
in relation to his near-contemporary and associate Friedrich Gilly, whose projects
have already been mentioned (Plate <a href='#pl009a'>9<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Indeed, Schinkel showed almost as great a
capacity to absorb and continue the revolutionary architectural ideals of the 1780s in
France as Gilly—more, certainly, than most of the foreigners who visited Paris during
the unproductive years following the Revolution, or even those who stayed on to study
there.</p>

<p class='c010'>Schinkel, however, soon to be one of the most architectonic of architects, made his
earliest mark not with architectural projects but, like Inigo Jones in England before
him, as a designer of theatre sets. Down to 1815 he executed no buildings of any consequence;
but in his paintings of these years, even more perhaps than in his stage sets, he
established himself as a High Romantic artist of real distinction. At their best these follow
in quality very closely after the master works of German Romantic landscape by
Caspar David Friedrich. Characteristically, buildings play an important part in Schinkel’s
pictures, and vast Gothic constructions in the ‘Sublime’ spirit of Wyatt’s Fonthill
Abbey are actually more frequent than Grecian or Italianate fabricks.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 5. Karl Friedrich von Schinkel: project for Neue Wache, Berlin, 1816</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But if Gothic projects form a more important part of his production on canvas, and
also on paper, in the first decades of the century than is the case with any other architect of
the period, even in England, Schinkel made his formal architectural debut as a Grecian
and a rationalist. Named by Frederick William III State architect in 1815, his project
of the next year for the Neue Wache (Figure <a href='#i029'>5</a>), Unter den Linden, facing Frederick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the Great’s opera house, is especially notable in the use of square piers—a Ledolcian
extreme of rationalist simplification—beneath the Grecian pediment. His intense
Romanticism also reveals itself in the heads of Pergamenian extravagance that writhe
forth from the frieze above. Not surprisingly, in the building as executed, and happily
still extant, Greek Doric columns replace the square piers. But the broad plain members
that frame the cubic mass behind and, above all, the superb proportions of the
whole reveal a surer hand than any other architect of the day in Germany possessed.
The contrast with Klenze’s Glyptothek, begun the same year, is notable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Schinkel’s Berlin Cathedral, as rebuilt in 1817-22 beside the Baroque Schloss of
Andreas Schlüter, was a modest work and none too successful; its replacement in 1894-1905
by the enormous Neo-Baroque structure of Julius Raschdorf was no great loss.</p>

<p class='c010'>There followed after the Cathedral a work of much greater scale, the Berlin Schauspielhaus,
designed in 1818 and built in 1819-21 (Plate <a href='#pl012'>12</a>). Here the complexity of the
mass diminishes somewhat the clarity of the geometrical order in the separate parts; but
Schinkel’s rationalistic handling of Grecian elements is nowhere better seen than in the
articulation of the attic by means of a ‘pilastrade’ of small antae or the reticulated organization
of the walls of the side wings. The interior of the auditorium boldly combines
very simple and heavily scaled wall elements with very delicately designed iron supports
for the ranges of boxes and galleries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Characteristic of the many-sidedness of Schinkel’s talent, if very much smaller and intrinsically
less happy, is the War Memorial, also of 1819-21, on the Kreuzberg in Berlin.
This is a Gothic shrine of the most lacy and linear design, 111 feet high and entirely
executed in cast iron.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Singakademie in Berlin of 1822 and a large house in Charlottenburg for the
banker Behrend, on the other hand, are very accomplished exercises in a rigidly Classical
mode such as his French contemporaries were currently essaying with markedly less
elegance of proportion. The Zivilcasino in Potsdam, begun the next year, where an
awkward site forced—or perhaps merely justified—an asymmetrical juxtaposition of the
parts, illustrated an aspect of Schinkel’s talent that is particularly significant to his
twentieth-century admirers: the imposition of coherent geometrical order upon an
edifice markedly irregular in its massing. This was something the English were only
playing at in these years when they designed Picturesque Italian Villas such as Nash’s
Cronkhill or loosely composed Castellated Mansions such as Gwrych (Plate <a href='#pl049'>49</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>It is characteristic of Romantic Classicism that Schinkel’s masterpiece—and, with
Soane’s later Bank interiors, the masterpiece of the period—should be a museum.
The Altes Museum, designed in 1823 and built in 1824-8, faces the Schloss across
the Lustgarten, to which Schinkel’s just completed Schlossbrücke gave a dignified
new approach. The Museum quite outranked his rather undistinguished cathedral; yet
at first glance it may seem one of the least original and most tamely archaeological of
Romantic Classical buildings (Plate <a href='#pl013'>13</a>). Substituting for the paradigm of the pedimented
peripteral temple that of the stoa, Schinkel evidently counted on the prestige of
a giant Grecian order to impress his contemporaries, quite as Brongniart had done at the
Paris Bourse (Plate <a href='#pl008b'>8<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). But the Museum retains the admiration of a twentieth century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>usually bored, and even shocked, by such stylophily because of the extraordinary logic
and elegance of its total organization.</p>

<p class='c010'>The frontal plane of superbly detailed Ionic columns is not weak at the corners, as
colonnades seen against the light generally are, for here spur walls ending in antae firmly
enframe the long, unbroken range. And if this frontal columnar plane is unbroken—and
also seems to deny by its giant scale the fact that this is a two-storey structure—within
the dark of the portico, made darker and more Romantic by a richly coloured mural
designed by Schinkel and executed under the direction of Peter Cornelius, one soon
becomes aware of a recessed oblong where a double flight of stairs leads to the upper
storey. Moreover, lest this façade be read, like a stoa, as no more than a portico, there
rises over the centre, still farther to the rear, a rectangular attic.</p>

<div id='i031'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 6. Karl Friedrich von Schinkel: Berlin, Altes Museum, 1824-8 section</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is characteristic of the purism of Schinkel’s approach, a purism not archaeological
but visual, that this attic masks externally a Durandesque central domed space (Figure
6). Such circular central spaces, so recurrent in Romantic Classical planning, had been
a favourite setting for classical sculpture, the principal treasure of most art collections
of this period, ever since the Museo Pio-Clementino was built at the Vatican. None
is finer than this in the proportional relationship of interior colonnade, plain wall
above, and coffered dome with oculus. Most, indeed, are but feeble copies of the Roman
Pantheon; this exceeds in distinction, if not in scale, its ancient original.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Museum, unlike the Munich Glyptothek, had to have picture galleries as
well as sculpture halls; and Schinkel’s organization of these, so much less palatial than
Klenze’s in his Pinakothek, is a technical triumph of the rationalistic side of Romantic
Classicism. Screens at right angles to the windows, and thus free from glare, provided
the greater part of the hanging space, a premonition almost of the movable screens of
mid-twentieth-century art galleries (Figure <a href='#i031'>6</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The external treatment of the rear walls of the Museum, moreover, achieved a clarity
of mathematical organization and a subtlety of structural expression in the detailing
which was also hardly equalled before the mid twentieth century. Tall windows in two
even ranges express clearly the two storeys of galleries behind; the stuccoed walls between
delicately suggest by their flat rustication—so like that Soane used on the Bank of
England—the scale of fine ashlar masonry. But the giant order of the front is also clearly
echoed in the flat corner antae just short of which the string-course between the storeys
and the rustication of the walls are stopped. A prototype of such detailing can be seen
in the Athenian Propylaea, no doubt familiar to Schinkel through publications; a derivation—or
at least a superb twentieth-century parallel—is the way Mies van der Rohe
handles the juxtaposition of steel stanchions and brick infilling in his buildings erected
for the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago in the last fifteen years
(see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The rapid deterioration of rationalist Grecian standards, which followed within a few
decades even in the hands of Schinkel’s ablest pupils, is to be noted in the Neues Museum,
built in 1843-55 by F. A. Stüler (1800-65) behind the Altes Museum. It is even more
evident in the contiguous Nationalgalerie, also by Stüler but based on a sketch by
Frederick William IV. This temple stands on a very high substructure in an awkward
perversion of the theme of Gilly’s monument to Frederick the Great and Klenze’s
Walhalla. It was finished only in 1876 by which time, even in Germany, Romantic
Classicism was completely dead (see Chapter <a href='#ch09'>9</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind his museum Schinkel himself had built in 1828-32, along the banks of the
Kupfergraben, the Packhofgebäude. This range of utilitarian structures was definitely
consonant, towards the Museum, with the Grecian rationalism of its rear façade. But
for the warehouses at the remote end of the group Schinkel used a rather direct transcription
of Durand’s paradigm for an arcuated market.<a id="r48"></a><a href='#f48' class='c025'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Here, at almost precisely the
same time as at Gärtner’s State Library in Munich and Hübsch’s Ministry of Finance in
Karlsruhe, the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> makes an early appearance as an alternative to the trabeated
Grecian. In comparably utilitarian works of a few years earlier, the Military Prison in
Berlin begun in 1825 and the lighthouse at Arkona of the same date, Schinkel had
already used dark brickwork unstuccoed, but with square rather than arched openings;
while on his long-demolished Hamburg Opera House, begun also in 1825 and completed
in 1827, there were arched openings throughout of a somewhat High Renaissance
order but far more severely treated than by Klenze on his Munich Pinakothek.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the year 1825 belongs too the beginning of the Werder Church in Berlin, Gothic
in its vaults, as also in its detail, and executed in brick and terracotta. Less just in its scaling
than his earlier Gothic monument of cast iron, this church as executed makes one regret
that Schinkel’s domed project of 1822, derived either from Vignon’s interior of the
Madeleine in Paris or from one of Durand’s paradigms, was not executed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1826 began Schinkel’s extensive and varied work for the Royal family at Potsdam,<a id="r49"></a><a href='#f49' class='c025'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
the town destined to be the richest centre of later Prussian Romantic Classicism. Here he
worked in close association with the heir to the throne who was later, after 1840, king
as Frederick William IV. This romantic and talented prince—who actually wished he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>were an architect rather than a ruler—frequently provided Schinkel and, after his death,
Schinkel’s pupils with sketches from which as we have seen in the case of the Nationalgalerie)
various executed buildings were elaborated with more or less success. One of
the great amateurs, his was a very late example of direct Royal intervention in architecture.
Some of the modulation of Schinkel’s style towards the Picturesque—still more
evident in the work at Potsdam of his ablest pupil Ludwig Persius (1803-45)—may
be credited to this princely patron.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Berlin, in the later twenties, Schinkel was also remodelling and redecorating palaces
for Frederick William’s brothers, major works in scale but rather limited in architectural
interest.<a id="r50"></a><a href='#f50' class='c025'><sup>[50]</sup></a> More characteristic of Schinkel’s best Grecian manner is the somewhat later
palace for Prince William built in 1834-5 by the younger Langhans (K. F., 1781-1869).
This architect’s still later theatre at Breslau, begun in 1843, is worth mention at this
point and also the old Russian Embassy of 1840-1 in Berlin by Eduard Knoblauch (1801-65),
but Schinkel’s comparable work is fifteen years earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Potsdam, even though much of what he did there also consisted of enlarging earlier
buildings, Schinkel was freer than in Berlin. Collaboration with the gardener P. J.
Lenné (1789-1866), who provided superb naturalistic settings in the tradition of the
English garden, may have encouraged a looser and less Classical sort of composition.
In many views, Charlottenhof with its dominating Greek Doric portico, remodelled
from 1826 on as the residence of the Crown Prince, may appear a sufficiently conventional
Greek Revival country house. But if one considers the planning of the house and
its close relation to the raised terrace, and also the relation to the solid block of the open
pergola—’an object of nature’ in Durand’s special sense—one sees that here, as earlier at
the Zivilcasino, but from no necessity enforced by the site, Schinkel sought to apply the
most stringent sort of geometrical order to an asymmetrical composition. For this, of
course, the Erechtheum and to some extent the Propylaea on the Akropolis, those two
fifth-century Greek examples of Romantic Classicism, provided precedents. At Schloss
Glienecke near by, also begun in 1826 for another Prussian prince, Karl, whose palace in
Berlin he was remodelling too, the Athenian derivation is very patent in the later belvedere
of 1837 based on the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. But it is the asymmetrical
massing of carefully organized elements here that reveals the extent to which Schinkel
was able to absorb and actually to synthesize with the discipline of Romantic Classicism
one of the major formal innovations of the Picturesque. The bold off-centre location of
the tower actually makes of this a sort of Italian Villa in the Cronkhill sense.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the enlargement of the medieval Kolberg Town Hall in Pomerania, begun in 1829,
Schinkel employed secular Late Gothic in a version as stiff and mechanical as that of
Gärtner’s Wittelsbach Palace a decade later. A remarkable centrally-planned Hunting
Lodge, built for Prince Radziwill at Ostrowo in 1827, on the other hand, illustrated a
bold attempt to apply the principles of Durandesque structural rationalism to building
in timber; the result is very different indeed from the contemporary American, Russian,
and Swedish houses of wood that were designed as copies of marble temples.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1828 a series of designs for churches in the new suburbs of Berlin, several of them
executed in reduced form in the early thirties, showed a drastic shift away from Classical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>models—still sometimes offered as alternatives and actually executed in two cases—towards
the creation of a very personal sort of <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. All intended to be of brick
with terracotta trim, these were less successful than the house he built of the same
materials for the brick and terracotta manufacturer Feilner in Berlin in 1829. In its perfect
regularity and rigid trabeation this recalled the rear of the Museum (Figure <a href='#i034'>7</a>). But
the employment of delicate arabesque reliefs in the jambs of the openings, quite in the
<i>quattrocento</i> way, illustrated rather more agreeably than the church projects the characteristic
modulation in these years away from Grecian and towards Italianate models.</p>

<div id='i034'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i034.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 7. Karl Friedrich von Schinkel: Berlin, Feilner House, 1829, elevation</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The happiest and most informal example of this modulation is to be seen in the Court
Gardener’s House on the Charlottenhof estate of 1829-31 (Plate <a href='#pl014a'>14<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The closely
associated Tea House and Roman Bath of 1833-4 loosely enclose the square rear garden
at the junction of two canals. As the plan of the house itself clearly reveals, this was not a
new construction but a remodelling, or encasing, of an earlier gardener’s house; but
more important to the total effect than the original solid block is the skilful disposition
of the clearly defined voids in the three-dimensional composition, voids which include
pergolas of varying height, loggias, and even an open attic below the main roof.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the one hand, the inspiration for this must have come from Durand’s illustrations
of the ‘employment of the objects of nature’ or perhaps from other French works<a id="r51"></a><a href='#f51' class='c025'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
more specifically dealing with Italian buildings in the countryside. On the other hand,
rather more than most English Italian Villas in the line of Nash’s Cronkhill, this seems
to be based on some real knowledge of Italian rural, not to say rustic, building. But
visually, as at Cronkhill and at Glienecke, the pivot of the whole composition is the
tower around which the various elements, solid and hollow, are as carefully organized
as in a piece of twentieth-century Neoplasticist sculpture. This Gardener’s House is as
much the international masterwork of the asymmetrically-towered Italian Villa mode,
one of the more modest yet extremely significant innovations of the first half of the
nineteenth century, as is the Altes Museum of formal Grecian Classicism.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>At Potsdam and near by Schinkel’s pupil Persius, before his untimely death only four
years after Schinkel’s, produced many other compositions of this order, often by remodelling
eighteenth-century buildings.<a id="r52"></a><a href='#f52' class='c025'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Two of the finest are the Pheasantry, which
is specifically a towered Italian Villa, and the group that includes the Friedenskirche,
carried out by others from Persius’s designs in 1845-8 (Plate <a href='#pl015'>15</a>). In this latter group the
principal feature is a close copy of an Early Christian basilica, even to the inclusion of a
real medieval apse mosaic brought from Murano; yet compositionally the group is
a masterpiece of the classically ordered Picturesque, rivalling Schinkel’s Gardener’s
House in subtlety and elegance. Even more personal to Persius is the delicacy of detailing
and the unusual external arcade of his earlier Heilandskirche of 1841-3, with its graceful
detached campanile, by the lakeside at nearby Sakrow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Also notable are his steam-engine houses, particularly that for Schloss Babelsberg.
The inclusion of medieval and even Islamic detail indicates the increasing eclecticism of
taste around 1840; yet the disparate elements are so scaled and ordered as to compose
into an asymmetrical pattern of Italian Villa character in which the minaret-like chimney
provides the dominant vertical accent. Less Picturesque is the Orangerieschloss, based on
a sketch by Frederick William IV and executed after Persius’s death by A. Hesse.</p>

<p class='c010'>Schinkel’s big Potsdam church, the Nikolaikirche, designed in 1829 and built up to
the base of the dome in the years 1830-7, stood right in the town, not in the park like his
work for the princes, and is a wholly formal monument. It was planned as a hemisphere
above a cube in the most geometrical mode of Romantic Classicism. As in the case of
Soufflot’s dome of the Panthéon, this was undoubtedly influenced by Wren’s St Paul’s
in London which Schinkel had seen on an English voyage in 1826. Unfortunately Persius
had later to add corner towers, almost like the minaret chimney of his Babelsberg
engine house, in order to load the pendentives when he completed the church in 1842-50.
These irrelevant features quite denature Schinkel’s formal intention. The interior, however,
is superior to those in most of the centrally planned churches of this period
in various countries that were based on the Roman Pantheon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Schinkel did not have such opportunities of building whole squares and streets as did
his Baden and his Bavarian contemporaries. For all his efforts, the Berlin Lustgarten
was probably never very satisfactory urbanistically because of the inadequate focus that
was provided by his modest cathedral beside the massive Baroque Schloss and the awkward
shift in the axis where the Schlossbrücke enters from Unter den Linden. At the
other end of Unter den Linden the Pariser Platz inside K. G. Langhans’s Brandenburg
Gate shows little evidence of Schinkel’s intended regularization of the surrounding buildings.
All that he was actually able to carry out there was the Palais Redern of 1832-3 (in
fact a remodelling), and this was demolished in 1906 to make way for the Adlon Hotel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The façades of the Palais Redern gave a <i>quattrocento</i> Florentine impression because of
their relatively bold over-all rustication; only the large openings were arcuated, however,
the ordinary windows being lintel-topped. Significant of Schinkel’s new interest
in asymmetrical order was the disposition of the four arched openings; these were
balanced in relation to the corner of Unter den Linden but unbalanced in relation to
either façade alone; the other windows were quite regularly spaced.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>If Schinkel seems to have adopted here a version of the Renaissance Revival—as, for
that matter, he had already done much earlier in his somewhat similar remodelling of
the Berlin City Hall in 1817—at the Neue Tor, also of 1832, he provided two gatehouses
which were in a sort of <i>Rundbogenstil</i> Tudor comparable to Gärtner’s Wittelsbach Palace
of fifteen years later. His trip to England<a id="r53"></a><a href='#f53' class='c025'><sup>[53]</sup></a> had fascinated him with English architecture,
old and new; there he had noted everything with intelligent interest—from medieval
castles to the towering new cotton mills near Manchester with their internal skeletons of
iron. He had no occasion, however, to make large-scale use of iron construction,
though there is little doubt that had he lived on through the forties he would have done
so with both technical and aesthetic mastery.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Schloss Babelsberg,<a id="r54"></a><a href='#f54' class='c025'><sup>[54]</sup></a> built for the rather tasteless brother of his own particular
patron, later the Emperor William I, he essayed an English sort of castle, admittedly
more in the contemporary Picturesque mode of the new Castellated Mansions of Nash
and Wyatt than like any real medieval one. This was designed in 1834 and begun in
1835. Persius took it over on Schinkel’s death, redesigning one of the principal towers,
and it was finally finished after Persius’s death by Heinrich Strack (1805-80) in 1849.
Though certainly not inferior to Smirke’s Eastnor or Cundy’s Hawarden, if without
the lovely site and the richly organic composition of Busby’s Gwrych, Babelsberg is
better appreciated in Schinkel’s or Persius’s drawings than in actuality. Schloss Kamenz,
a rather Tudoresque remodelling of an earlier structure which Schinkel undertook in
1838, is more typical but no more successful.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although playing but a very minor part in Schinkel’s own production, his exercises
in the Chalet mode should at least be mentioned. Not only do these illustrate the very
wide range of his own eclectic inspiration, considerably wider than that of Durand and
the French of the previous generation, they also represent one of the peripheral aspects
of his achievement which his pupils, and German architects of the mid century generally,
delighted to exploit. The happiest work of his followers, however, continued
rather the Italian Villa line of Glienecke and the Court Gardener’s House, a line in
which Persius at least all but equalled his master.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Grecian work of Schinkel’s imitators and emulators tended to be overdecorated
and lacking in geometrical order while their <i>Rundbogenstil</i> is in general awkwardly proportioned
and incoherently ornamented (see Chapter <a href='#ch09'>9</a>). Outside Prussia, such Hamburg
architects as Wimmel &amp; Forsmann and de Chateauneuf illustrate better than
other North Germans the real possibilities of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. De Chateauneuf had
something of an international reputation, moreover, after winning the second prize in
the competition held in 1839-40 for the Royal Exchange in London. His design for that
was based on the Loggia dei Lanzi, and may well have provided the suggestion for
Gärtner’s Feldherrenhalle in Munich begun the next year.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is impossible and unnecessary to follow Romantic Classicism to all the other German
centres. At Darmstadt the Classical Ludwigskirche of 1822-7 by Georg Moller
(1784-1852),<a id="r55"></a><a href='#f55' class='c025'><sup>[55]</sup></a> a pupil of Weinbrenner, is a handsome circular edifice with an internal
colonnade below the dome. Thus it is rather like the ‘central space’ in Schinkel’s
Museum, but more broadly proportioned. A boldly arched entrance of almost Ledolcian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>character is set against the external circumference of blank wall rather than the more
usual temple portico. The Artillery Barracks at Darmstadt of 1825-7 by Moller’s pupil
Franz Heger (1792-1836) provided a notably early example of the  <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. Comparable
was August Busse’s Castellated Zellengefängnis in Berlin of 1842-9, the first
German example of a penitentiary radially planned and with individual cells (see
Chapter 5). Stüler’s destroyed Trinitatiskirche in Cologne, a Persius-like Early Christian
basilica completed in 1860, was much finer than his Berlin churches (see Chapter <a href='#ch09'>9</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Also <i>Rundbogenstil</i>, but of a more medievalizing order, was Semper’s Synagogue of
1838-41 in Dresden. Its centralized massing is uncharacteristically plastic. His Palais
Oppenheim there of 1845-8 at 9-11 An der Bürgerwiese, based on Raphael’s Pandolfini
Palace, was a handsome and very ‘correct’ example of the international Renaissance
Revival to be compared, like de Meuron’s house in Hamburg, with Barry’s London
clubhouses. The Cholera Fountain of 1843 in Dresden was Gothic, however, providing
further evidence of Semper’s rather directionless eclecticism at this time.</p>

<p class='c010'>His principal works of this period were the first Opera House<a id="r56"></a><a href='#f56' class='c025'><sup>[56]</sup></a> in Dresden of 1837-41,
where Wagner’s early triumphs took place, burnt and rebuilt by Semper later, and
the nearby Art Gallery of 1847-54 which completed so unhappily the circuit of the
marvellous Rococo Zwinger by Daniel Pöppelmann. The one was a rather festive, the
other a rather solemn example of the Renaissance Revival; both are more notable for
their planning and their general organization than for any visual distinction (Figure <a href='#i037'>8</a>).
The Opera House in Hanover, built by G. L. F. Laves (1789-1864) in 1845-52, is less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>original in plan but more sober, even a bit Schinkelesque, in design (Plate <a href='#pl014b'>14<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Its interior
has been completely done over since it was bombed in the Second World War.</p>

<p class='c010'>The historian tends always to press forward, forcing rather than retarding the pace of
development in his written account. Klenze’s Propylaeon, however, has already provided
evidence of the late continuance of Grecian ideals in the German States; in Stuttgart
the Königsbau of 1857-60 by C. F. Leins (1814-92), a pupil in Paris of Henri
Labrouste, provides a worthier example, although this was actually begun twenty years
earlier by J. M. Knapp (1793-1861). In Vienna, as late as 1873, the Parliament House of
Theophil von Hansen (1813-91) provides a gargantuan example of what the French had
first aspired to build almost a century earlier. Ambiguous in its massing, if still very
elegant in its Grecian detail, this contrasts markedly with Hansen’s other Viennese work
of the third quarter of the century which is generally of High Renaissance design (see
Chapter 8).</p>

<p class='c010'>This Copenhagen-born and trained architect knew Greece at first hand, for he and his
brother H. C. Hansen (1803-83) worked in Athens for some years for the Wittelsbachs
and the Danish dynasty that succeeded them. Along University Street in Athens a conspicuous
range of porticoed structures is theirs. The University, built in 1837-42, is by
the elder brother; the Academy, built in 1859-87, was designed by Theophil and executed
by his pupil Ernst Ziller; the National Library was also designed by Theophil in
1860 and completed in 1892. Conventional essays in the international Greek Revival
mode, here made somewhat ironical by their proximity to the great fifth-century ruins,
these lack the elegance and refinement of Theophil’s Palais Dimitriou of 1842-3 (lately
destroyed by the enlargement of the Grande Bretagne Hotel towards Syndagma Square)
as also the more than Schinkelesque restraint of the earliest Romantic Classical building
in Greece. This is Gärtner’s gaunt but distinguished Old Palace,<a id="r57"></a><a href='#f57' class='c025'><sup>[57]</sup></a> designed in 1835-6 for
Otho of Wittelsbach immediately after his assumption of the Greek throne and built in
1837-41 (Plate <a href='#pl017a'>17<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Palace and its neighbour the Grande Bretagne still dominate the centre of
modern Athens. The palace, in its regularity, its austerity, and its geometrical clarity of
design, is a finer archetype of the most rigid Romantic Classical ideals than anything
Gärtner built in Munich; indeed, perhaps those ideals were nowhere else ever followed
so drastically at monumental scale except in Denmark. One may even wonder irreverently
if the fifth century had many civil buildings that were so pure and so calm!</p>

<p class='c010'>Gärtner and the Hansens set the pace for a local Greek Revival vernacular of a rather
North European order. In its detail this vernacular sometimes exceeds in delicacy that
of the later centuries of antiquity, as illustrated here in the Stoa of Attalos in the
Agora—at least as that has lately been reconstructed—or the Arch of Hadrian. Not all of
the new construction was Grecian, however: Klenze’s Roman Catholic Cathedral (Aghios
Dionysios) in University Street is a basilica with Renaissance detail, built in 1854-63;
the modest English Church of 1840-3 is rather feebly Gothic and reputedly based on a
design provided by C. R. Cockerell that was much modified in execution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the leading Greek architects of the period, Lyssander Kaftanzoglou (1812-85),
Stamathios Kleanthis (1802-62), and Panajiotis Kalkos (1800?-1870?), only Kleanthis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>was German-trained. This talented pupil of Schinkel followed his master’s Italianate
rather than his Grecian line, and the house he built in 1840 for the Duchesse de Plaisance
on Kiffisia Avenue (now the Byzantine Museum) is a distinguished example of a
Durandesque Italian villa, with simple arcading front and rear and low corner towers.
Kaftanzoglou, trained at the École de Beaux-Arts in Paris and in Milan, was somewhat
less able; but the large quadrangular Grecian structure that he designed in the fifties and
built in 1862-80 to house the Polytechneion in Patissia Street more than rivals the
academic buildings by the Hansens in University Street in the careful ordering of its
parts and the correct elegance of its details. Of Kalkos’s work little remains in good
condition today.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new capital of remote Greece possesses more, and on the whole more impressive,
Romantic Classical buildings than do Vienna and Budapest, capitals of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire. In them ambitious urbanistic projects were initiated only later after
the accession of Francis Joseph in 1848. The Theseus Temple in the Volksgarten in Vienna
of 1821-3 by Peter von Nobile (1774-1854),<a id="r58"></a><a href='#f58' class='c025'><sup>[58]</sup></a> a Swiss who had made his reputation
in Trieste, is hardly more than a large Grecian garden ornament conscientiously copying
the fifth-century Hephaisteion in Athens line for line. His nearby Burgtor, begun the
following year, is much worthier in its heavy, almost Sanmichelian, way. More characteristic,
however, is the work of Joseph Kornhäusel (1782-1860) and of Paul Sprenger
(1798-1854).</p>

<p class='c010'>Kornhäusel’s Schottenhof, opening off the Schottengasse, is a housing development
built in 1826-32 in collaboration with Joseph Adelpodinger (1778-1849). This is of
extraordinary extent and arranged very regularly around several large internal courts.
The smooth stucco walls, restricted ornamentation, and regular fenestration, brought
out to the wall surface by double windows, can be matched in many streets of the city
that were built up in these decades. Behind such a façade in the Seitenstettengasse lies
Kornhäusel’s elegant but rather modest Synagogue of 1825-6. This has an elliptical
dome and an internal colonnade that carries a narrow gallery. Much richer is his rectangular
main hall of 1823-4 in the Albertina; as has been noted, this palace had already
been enlarged in 1801-4 in Romantic Classical style by Montoyer. Kornhäusel’s hall is
finished in mirror and in pale yellow and pale mauve scagliola with chalk-white
Grecian details and sandstone statues of the Muses by J. Klieber.</p>

<p class='c010'>With Kornhäusel all is classical; Sprenger, on the other hand, employed a rather tight
version of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>, more Renaissance than medievalizing, for his considerably
later Mint of 1835-7 in the Heumarkt in Vienna. More original, and with charming
arched window-frames of terracotta in delicate floral bands, is his Landeshauptmannschaft
of 1846-8 at 11 Herrengasse. This contrasts happily with the Diet of Lower
Austria, projected in 1832-3 and built in 1837-44 by Luigi Pichl (1782-1856), next door
at No. 13, a rather heavy and conventional example of Romantic Classicism; so also
does No. 17, a very simple block originally built by Moreau for the Austro-Hungarian
Bank in 1821-3. The later bank building across the Herrengasse at No. 14, built by
Heinrich von Ferstel (1828-83) in 1856-60, well illustrates the modulation of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>
here, as in Germany, towards richer and more Gothicizing forms after the mid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>century. The glass-roofed passage extending through this to the Freyung is still very
attractive, despite its shabby condition, and worthy of comparison with other extant
examples of passages elsewhere in the Old and New Worlds
(see Chapters <a href='#ch03'>3</a>, <a href='#ch05'>5</a>, and <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The great nineteenth-century Viennese building campaign of Francis Joseph began in
1849 with the initiation of the Arsenal. There the outer ranges (now mostly destroyed
by bombing) were completed in 1855 from designs by Edward Van der Nüll (1812-65),
a pupil of Nobile and Sprenger, and his partner August Siccard von Siccardsburg (1813-68).
The Army Museum of 1850-6 is by Ludwig Foerster (1797-1863) and Theophil
von Hansen (who had married Forster’s daughter after moving from Athens to Vienna),
and the chapel of 1853-5 is by Karl Rosner (1804-59). These are all in slightly varying
<i>Rundbogenstil</i> modes, and they show, like Ferstel’s bank, the changed taste of the mid
century, most notably in their rather violent brick polychromy (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In Budapest the National Museum of 1837-44 by Michael Pollák (1773-1855) is
a vast rectangle fronted in the conventional way by an octostyle Corinthian portico
and with a somewhat Schinkel-like severity of treatment on the side wings. This is
another major example of the museums which were such characteristic monuments of
Romantic Classicism everywhere. Among many other large and typical public monuments
designed by Pollák, the Kommitat Building may be mentioned as of comparable
size and dignity to his museum.</p>

<p class='c010'>If first Greece and then Austria employed Danish Hansens in the forties and fifties, the
earlier Romantic Classical tradition of C. F. Hansen, who in any case lived on until
1845, was still better maintained at home by his pupil M. G. B. Bindesbøll (1800-56).
Where C. F. Hansen’s inspiration was Roman and Parisian, Bindesbøll’s seems rather
to have been German, as was common in his generation. Certainly his masterpiece,
again a museum and indeed a museum of sculpture, out-Schinkels Schinkel. The
Thorvaldsens Museum<a id="r59"></a><a href='#f59' class='c025'><sup>[59]</sup></a> in Copenhagen was built in 1839-48 to house the sculpture
and the collections of the thoroughly Romanized Bertil Thorwaldsen, which he had
determined in 1837 to present to his native country. The mode, of course, is Greek but
completely astylar like the rear of Schinkel’s Berlin Museum; the general impression,
particularly of the court with Thorvaldsen’s tomb in its centre, is surprisingly Egyptian
(Plate <a href='#pl016b'>16<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The mathematical severity of the architectural design is warmed by the
murals on the walls, once largely washed away but now all renewed; they romanticize
thoroughly its rigid geometrical forms. Even the purely architectural elements, moreover,
were once polychromed, if the present restoration of the colour is correct.</p>

<p class='c010'>The murals on the exterior of the museum were designed in 1847-8 and executed in
1850 by Jørgen Sonne in a sort of coloured plaster intarsia with heavy black outlines.
Developing a happy idea of Bindesbøll’s, these tell rather realistically the story of the
transport of the sculpture from Rome to Copenhagen. The foliate work on the court
walls was carried out by H. C. From in 1844—laurel-trees, oaks, and palms. In the
interiors, where Thorwaldsen disposed his own sculptures somewhat less formally than
he had the Aegina sculptures in the Munich Glyptothek, the intricate and brightly
coloured decoration of the barrel vaults is in that Pompeian mode which had been a part
of the Romantic Classical tradition ever since the time of Clérisseau and Adam. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>provides a happy contrast to so much Neo-Classic white marble statuary set against
plain walls painted in strong flat colours. The finest of these ceilings have no modern
rivals, even in Adam’s eighteenth-century work, for the precise geometrical organization
of the panels and the delicate refinement of the very low plaster reliefs. Bolder and
wholly abstract are the floors of tile mosaic arranged in a bewildering variety of patterns,
some imitated from Roman models but more of them so original in design that they
suggest ‘hardedge’ paintings of the 1960s.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his few other executed works and projects Bindesbøll showed himself considerably
less Classical and Schinkelesque than in this museum; perhaps the museum reflects Thorvaldsen’s
taste as much or more than his own. Tending, like other Danes of his generation,
towards the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> in his urban buildings, for his country houses he arrived
at a very direct and logical rural mode in which rustic materials and asymmetrical compositions
were controlled by a Romantic Classical sense of order and decorum. If, on
the one hand, his interest in bold structural polychromy in the fifties parallels that of the
English Butterfield, his domestic mode forecasts that of the English Webb
(see Chapters <a href='#ch10'>10</a> and <a href='#ch12'>12</a>). Bindesbøll’s production was small indeed,
but at least the very simple
<i>Rundbogenstil</i> Agricultural School of 1856-8 at 13 Bulowsvej in Copenhagen, executed
after his death, deserves specific mention here.</p>

<p class='c010'>J. D. Herholdt (1818-1902), living almost half a century longer than Bindesbøll, was
naturally more productive. He was also a master of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> hardly rivalled in
his generation even by the ablest Germans. Late as is his National Bank at 17 Holmens
Kanal in Copenhagen—1866-70—this is one of the finest examples anywhere of the
more Tuscan sort of <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. His University Library of 1857-61 in the Frue Plads
is less suave in design but much more original in its brick detailing. As late as the eighties
he maintained the Romantic Classical discipline in his Italian Gothic Raadhus at Odense
of 1880-3 as well as carrying out many tactful restorations of Romanesque churches. Of
his fine Copenhagen Station of 1863-4 the wooden shed now serves on another site as
a sports hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>G. F. Hetsch (1830-1903) also continued the Romantic Classical line, most happily
perhaps in his Sankt Ansgarskirke of 1841-2, the Roman Catholic church in the Bredgade
in Copenhagen. Ferdinand Meldahl (1827-1908), although capable of very disciplined
Early Renaissance design in his office building at 23 Havnegade in Copenhagen
of 1864, led Danish architecture away from Romantic Classicism and the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>
towards a rather Second Empire sort of eclecticism after he became professor at the
Copenhagen Academy in 1864 and its director in 1873 (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>With its great individual monuments by C. F. Hansen and Bindesbøll and its streets
of fine houses in the Romantic Classical vernacular, Copenhagen provides today a more
attractive picture of the production of this period than almost any other city. Norway,
at this time less prosperous than Denmark, has work by Schinkel himself. At least the
designs for the buildings of the University at Christiania, erected in 1841-51 by C. H.
Grosch (1801-65), a pupil of C. F. Hansen and of Hetsch, were revised by Schinkel just
before his death, and the handling of the walls is certainly quite characteristic of his
work in the clarity and logic of their articulation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>In Sweden, where the dominant influences in the early nineteenth century were first
French and then German as in Denmark, there was no comparably brilliant development
of Romantic Classicism. Rosendal, a country house built in 1823-5 by Fredrik
Blom (1781-1851), is a pleasant and very discreet edifice that might well be by almost
any French architect of Blom’s generation. His Skeppsholm Church in Stockholm of
1824-42, circular within and octagonal without, is a typical but not especially distinguished
work of its period. More characteristic are the modest wooden houses with
Grecian detail. These are similar to, but in their naive ‘correctness’ less extreme than,
the temple houses of Russia and the United States. Their board-and-batten walls might,
paradoxically, have inspired one aspect of Downing’s anti-Grecian campaign in
America in the forties (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1850 Stüler was called to Stockholm from Berlin to design the National Museum.
Eventually completed in 1865, this is in a richer Venetian Renaissance mode than he
usually employed at home. Such more definitely Romantic modes were generally exploited
by native architects only much later. For example, the Sodra Theatre of 1858-9
in Stockholm by J. F. Åbom (1817-1900) is still quite a restrained example of the
revived High Renaissance; while so excellent a specimen of the more Tuscan sort of
<i>Rundbogenstil</i> as the Skandias Building in Stockholm by P. M. R. Isaeus (1841-90) and
C. Sundahl dates from 1886-9, but must be compared with German work of at least a
generation earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>Holland has even less of distinction to offer in this period than Sweden.<a id="r60"></a><a href='#f60' class='c025'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Yet the
Lutheran Round Church on the Singel in Amsterdam, as it was rebuilt after a fire in
1826 by Jan de Greef (1784-1834) and T. F. Suys (1783-1861), a pupil of Percier, lends
a distinctly Venetian air to the local scene with its great dome, despite the admirably
Dutch quality of its fine brickwork. The original church was built in 1668-77 by
Adriaen Dortsmann, and doubtless the peculiar plan, with main entrance under the
pulpit and double galleries at the rear outside the main rotunda, derives from the older
building.</p>

<p class='c010'>The monumentally Classical Haarlemer Poort of 1840 in Amsterdam by J. D. Zocher
(1790-1870) may also be mentioned, as it is nearly unique in Holland. This has the
stuccoed walls that, in Holland as elsewhere, generally replaced exposed brickwork
under the influence of international Romantic Classicism. The Academy of Fine Arts in
The Hague, built by Z. Reijers in 1839 and demolished in 1933, dominated by an Ionic
portico of stone, might well have risen in any French provincial city of the day. Very
similar, except that the portico is Corinthian, is the Palace of Justice in Leeuwarden built
in 1846-52 by T. A. Romein (1811-81). Handsome also, but like the Hague Academy
less autochthonous in character than the Round Church, is the long stone façade beside
the Rokin of the Nederlandsche Bank in the Turfmarkt (1860) by Willem Anthony
Froger. On the whole, Holland is the exception that proves the rule. Almost alone in
Northern Europe Dutch architects failed, in general, to accept Romantic Classicism as
it was adumbrated most notably in the treatise of Durand; while local conditions, in any
case, reduced monumental architectural production to a minimum in the decades
between Waterloo and the mid century.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Before</span> considering English architecture in the years between Waterloo and the Great
Exhibition, it will be well to turn to that of France. The drama of the supersession of a
supposedly purely Classical school in painting by a purely Romantic one, the contrast
between such giants as Ingres on the one hand and Delacroix on the other, cannot be
matched in the tame course of French architecture in this period; only very rarely was
the accomplishment of these great painters or of half a dozen others, ranging from
Géricault and Bonington to Corot and Daumier, equalled in quality by a Henri Labrouste
or a Duban. Although the art of Ingres is in many ways parallel to Romantic Classicism
in architecture, no French architect of this generation really approaches him at all closely
in stature, although he numbered several among his close friends. Still less is there among
architects any rebellious Romantic of the distinction of Delacroix or any ‘independent’
comparable to Corot.</p>
<p class='c010'>The Empire left a vast heritage of unfinished monuments. It is properly to the credit
of the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe that these were brought to completion a generation
after their initiation; but all the credit for them has in fact generally accrued to
Napoleon himself. The intervening Restoration of the returned Bourbons, tired,
reactionary and bigoted, gave its support largely to the construction of religious buildings.
Appropriately, the first important new commission under Louis XVIII was for the
Chapelle Expiatoire in memory of his brother Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. This
chapel with its raised tomb-flanked forecourt, lying between the Rue Pasquier and the
Rue d’Anjou off the Boulevard Haussmann, was begun in 1816 and completed in 1824
(Plate <a href='#pl018a'>18<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Somewhat less appropriately, it was Napoleon’s favourite architect Fontaine—his
partner Percier had by this time retired—who received the commission. But
the character of the project and of the regime led him to modulate his earlier imperial
style from the festive and the triumphal towards the solemn and the funereal. Not an
unworthy example of Romantic Classicism, this nevertheless lacks the crispness and
clarity of the best contemporary German work. Nor does it much recall—as it well
might have done—either the delicacy of the <i>style Louis XVI</i> or the ‘Sublime’ grandeur
of the many projects for monumental cenotaphs designed by the previous generation of
architects and by those of Fontaine’s own generation in their youth.</p>

<p class='c010'>To restore the strength of the church, as the piety of the later Bourbons demanded,
priests had to be trained in quantity. The next significant work undertaken in Paris
after the Chapelle Expiatoire was the Séminaire Saint-Sulpice in the Place St Sulpice by
É.-H. Godde (1781-1869); this was begun in 1820 and completed in 1838. So flat and
cold are its façades that the observer may readily fail to note that the design somewhat
approaches, perhaps unconsciously, the <i>quattrocento</i> Florentine. However, it quite lacks
the archaeological character of Klenze’s Königsbau in Munich, designed only a few years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>later, or the vigour and assurance of Wimmel &amp; Forsmann’s Johanneum in Hamburg.
In fact, of course, it derives almost directly from Durand and not from any careful study
of Grandjean de Montigny’s <i>Architecture toscane</i>. Somewhat more definitely Early Renaissance
in detail are the Baths at Mont d’Or, built by L.-C.-F. Ledru (1771-1861), a
pupil of Durand, in 1822, and the Barracks in the Rue Mouffetard in Paris as extended
in 1827 by Charles Rohault de Fleury (1801-75). Both exploit a rusticated Tuscan
mode somewhat as Klenze was doing in Munich, but much less archaeologically.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shortly after the Séminaire, Godde undertook several Paris churches. Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou
in the Rue St Dominique of 1822-3 replaced a church destroyed in the
Revolution. Finer and considerably larger is Saint-Denis-du-Saint-Sacrament in the Rue
de Turenne, built in 1823-35. Both are barrel-vaulted basilicas in the tradition of
Chalgrin’s Saint-Philippe-du-Roule; the latter is rather elegant in its dry severity, the
former confused by various later additions behind the altar. Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle
of 1823-30 is smaller and more modest, as are also two nearly contemporary
Paris churches by A.-I. Molinos (1795-1850), Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Neuilly of 1827-31
and Sainte-Marie-des-Batignolles in the Place du Dr Félix Lobligeois in Paris of 1828-9.
All these churches lack externally the Grecian grandeur of scale of the London churches
of the period built by the Inwoods and others (see Chapter <a href='#ch04'>4</a>), but the basilican plan
provides interiors that are considerably more interesting than the galleried halls with
which most English architects were satisfied at this time. Of course, such a highly
original interior as that of Soane’s St Peter’s, Walworth, of 1822 is in a different class
altogether.</p>

<p class='c010'>A much larger and more prominent church than any of Godde’s or Molinos’s is Notre-Dame-de-Lorette
in the Rue de Chateaudun, one of the few really distinguished products
of this dull period. It was the result of a competition held in 1822 which was won
by Lebas, Brongniart’s collaborator on the Bourse (Plate <a href='#pl018b'>18<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This five-aisled edifice
was built at very great expense in 1823-36 and sumptuously decorated with murals that
added as much as a sixth to the total cost. The basic model is again the Early Christian
basilica but here interpreted in thoroughly Classical terms, with a tall temple portico
rivalling those of London at the front and no vaults or arches except at the east end.
Evidence of a certain eclecticism is the rich coffering of the ceiling in panels alternately
square and cruciform; so also is the introduction of a domed chancel before the
apse. Both features are certainly of <i>cinquecento</i> inspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>To modern eyes, attuned to the late fifth-and sixth-century basilicas of Ravenna,
Notre-Dame-de-Lorette certainly has a far less Early Christian air than Ziebland’s
Bonifazius Basilika in Munich of the next decade; but doubtless the great Imperial
basilicas of Rome of the fourth and early fifth centuries, notably Santa Maria Maggiore
with its trabeated nave colonnade, were originally something like it. In any case, Lebas’s
church is a highly typical monument of Romantic Classicism and a major one. In
France, as elsewhere, the accepted range of precedent now extended well beyond Greek
and Roman antiquity to include Italian models of fifth- and of sixteenth-century date, if
very little from the centuries between. Even before the construction of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette,
the Belgian-born P.-J. Sandrié and Jacob Silveyra (1785-?) in building a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>big Parisian synagogue in the Rue Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth in 1819-20 had also followed
rather closely the basilican formula.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most important Parisian church of the second quarter of the century, Saint-Vincent-de-Paul
off the Rue Lafayette, is also a five-aisled classical basilica (Plate <a href='#pl019'>19</a>).
This was begun in 1824 by Lepère, but work was soon suspended. When it was carried
to completion in 1831-44 Lepère’s son-in-law J.-I. Hittorff (1792-1867) took over, and he
has generally received credit for the whole job. In utilizing a rising site, which required
terraces and flights of steps in front, and in providing two towers, Lepère and Hittorff
gave their church more prominence and a richer, if rather clumsily organized, three-dimensional
interest.<a id="r61"></a><a href='#f61' class='c025'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Hittorff’s archaeological studies in Sicily had made him an enthusiast
for architectural polychromy, and to contemporaries the great novelty about
Saint-Vincent-de-Paul was the proposal to use enamelled lava plaques on the exterior.<a id="r62"></a><a href='#f62' class='c025'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The French did not, like the Germans, turn to the use of tawny brick and terracotta in
the second quarter of the century; but the interest of Hittorff and his generation
in applied polychromy relates their work a little to that of the Romantic colourists in
painting.<a id="r63"></a><a href='#f63' class='c025'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Unfortunately almost none of this polychromy remains visible now; and so
the shift away from the monochromy that is characteristic everywhere of Romantic
Classicism down to this period is less evident in France than in other countries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Especially fine is the open timber roof of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, although in fact
only a part of the actual construction is exposed; while the fact that the colonnaded
apse is wide enough to include the inner aisles as well as the nave gives a quite unprecedented
spatial interest to the east end. Moreover, in this interior Hittorff achieved a
rich warmth of tone quite different from the coldness of Godde’s and Molinos’s churches
of the twenties. His Cirque des Champs Élysées of 1839-41 and Cirque d’Hiver of 1852
were even more brilliantly polychromatic both inside and out. But the most conspicuous
extant works of Hittorff, the Gare du Nord of 1861-5, the Second Empire façades
surrounding the Place de l’Étoile, and the decoration of the Place de la Concorde and
the Champs Élysées with fountains and other features under the July Monarchy, provide
today little evidence<a id="r64"></a><a href='#f64' class='c025'><sup>[64]</sup></a> of this aspect of his talent once so notable to contemporaries
at home and abroad.</p>

<p class='c010'>Especially happy is the siting of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul on the upper side of the new
polygonal Place Charles X (now Place Lafayette), of which the other sides were filled in
the twenties with consonant houses by A.-F.-R. Leclerc (1785-1853),<a id="r65"></a><a href='#f65' class='c025'><sup>[65]</sup></a> a pupil of both
Durand and Percier, and A.-J. Pellechet (1789-1871). Less characteristic of Romantic
Classical urbanism than the squares and streets of Karlsruhe and Munich, this nevertheless
well illustrates the dignity and the regularity of the houses then rising in the new
quarters of Paris. The very considerable new quarter in Mulhouse, which was laid out
and built up in 1826-8 by J.-G. Stotz (1799-?), a pupil of Leclerc, and A.-J.-F. Fries
(1800-59), a pupil of Huyot, is more properly comparable with Karlsruhe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most of the new churches in the suburbs of Paris and the French provinces followed
basilican models. The parish church of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which was brought at
last to completion in 1823-7 by A.-J. Malpièce (1789-1864) and his partner A.-J. Moutier
(1791-1874), a pupil of Percier, following the original designs of M.-M. Potain (1713-96)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>of the 1760s, is much more modest and somewhat less Roman. In Marseilles the
younger M.-R. Penchaud (1772-1832), who designed in 1812 and built in 1827-32
the Palais de Justice at Aix on Ledoux’s earlier foundations, erected in 1824 a large
Roman basilica for the local Protestants, doubtless with some conscious reference
to Salomon de Brosse’s seventeenth-century Protestant Temple at Charenton of two
hundred years earlier. By exception, however, the Protestant Temple at Orléans by
F.-N. Pagot (1780-1844), a pupil of Labarre, which was built in 1836, is a plain cylinder
in plan. Saint-Lazare in Marseilles, built by P.-X. Coste (1787-1879) and Vincent
Barral (1800-54) in 1833-7, followed Notre-Dame-de-Lorette even more closely than
does Penchaud’s Protestant church.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the more modest parish church of Vincennes outside Paris, which rose in 1826-30,
the very last years of the Restoration, J.-B.-C. Lesueur (1794-1883) was already using a
rather Brunelleschian sort of detail that is not without a certain cool elegance. More
definitely of the Renaissance Revival is Saint-Jacques-Saint-Christophe, the parish church
of La Villette in the Rue de Crimée in Paris built by P.-E. Lequeux (1806-73) much
later, in 1841-4. It is one of half a dozen that Lequeux began in the forties, in addition to
designing the town halls of this and several other quarters of Paris. Lequeux employed
definitely <i>quattrocento</i> detail somewhat more lavishly than Lesueur had done at Vincennes,
and produced at La Villette one of the most satisfactory French churches of
the Louis Philippe epoch. In building a small Norman church at Pollet near Dieppe
in 1844-9, Louis Lenormand (1801-62), a pupil of his uncle Huvé, used Early Renaissance
detail of a more French sort that may not improperly be called <i>François I.</i> Such
detail was highly exceptional in ecclesiastical architecture even as late as the forties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The housing of public services, initiated so actively by Napoleon, continued at a
much reduced pace under Louis XVIII and Charles X. The Paris Custom House of 1827
by L.-A. Lusson (1790-1864), a pupil of Percier, with its great arched entrance rising
from the ground and its similar transverse arches inside, was later transformed—three
bays of it, at least—into a Protestant church by one of Lebas’s pupils, the German-born
F.-C. Gau (1790-1853), for Louis Philippe’s German relatives in 1843. A similar reflection
of Durand’s utilitarian models may be seen in the vast Government Warehouse at
Lyons, begun in 1828 by L.-P. Baltard (1764-1846), Lequeux’s master, who had worked
when very young with Ledoux on the Paris <i>barrières</i>. This contrasts notably in its consistent
arcuation with the belated giant Corinthian colonnade that fronts Baltard’s
Palace of Justice there, built in 1836-42, and parallels fairly closely the contemporary
warehouses Schinkel was building in Berlin. More characteristic of the rather mixed
official mode of the period is the Custom House of 1835-42 at Rouen by C.-E. Isabelle
(1800-80), a pupil of Leclerc. This is of interest chiefly for the tremendous rusticated
arch of the entrance, which quite overpowers the rest of the <i>palazzo</i>-like façade.</p>

<p class='c010'>For educational institutions most new construction was subsidiary to existing buildings.
At the École Polytechnique, A.-M. Renié (<i>c.</i> 1790-1855), a pupil of Percier and
Vaudoyer, provided in 1828 a new arcuated and rusticated entrance hardly worthy of
the school where Durand was now teaching a second generation of architects. P.-M.
Letarouilly (1795-1855) made in 1831-42 additions that are less unworthy, but hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>more interesting, to Chalgrin’s Collège de France, built originally in the 1770s. But his
great contribution, of course, was the <i>Édifices de Rome moderne</i>—the first volume of
which appeared in 1840. Finally completed with the publication of the third volume in
1857, this was the bible of the later Renaissance Revival in France as of several generations
of academic architects throughout the rest of the world. The École Normale
Supérieure by the youngest Gisors (H.-A.-G. de, 1796-1866), a pupil of Percier, is a
large, wholly new building of 1841-7; this looks forward to the Second Empire a little
in its high mansard roof and seventeenth-century detailing, extremely dry and sparse
though that is (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Private construction was for the most part very dull, whether in city, suburb, or
country. As an example of the country houses that were built in some quantity, a typical
project of 1830 for one by Hittorff may be illustrated (Figure <a href='#i047'>9</a>). With its careful if rather
uninteresting proportions, its rigid rectangularity, and the stiff chains of rustication that
provide its sole embellishment, however, this rises somewhat above the general level of
achievement of the period.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>François I</i> character of the detailing of Lenormand’s Pollet church has been mentioned.
In domestic architecture such national Renaissance precedent had rather greater
success even if nothing very novel or original developed from it. In 1825 L.-M.-D. Biet
(1785-1856), a pupil of Percier, brought to Paris the court façade of an early sixteenth-century
house from Moret and applied it to a <i>hôtel particulier</i>—always called with no
justification the ‘Maison de François I’—in a new residential area of Paris. This house
shortly gave the name ‘François I’ to the entire quarter between the Champs Élysées
and the Seine. The barrenness and brittleness of Biet’s own elevations were more of a
tribute to his respect for the old work than to his creative ability.</p>

<div id='i047'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 9. J.-I. Hittorff: Project for country house for Comte de W., 1830, elevation</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Within the next few years houses built by such architects as L.-T.-J. Visconti (1791-1853),
another pupil of Percier, and Famin tended to grow ever richer. In 1835 P.-C.
Dusillion (1804-60), an architect otherwise more active abroad than at home, used <i>François
I</i> detail with the lushest profusion on a house at 14 Rue Vaneau. The façade rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>resembles an interior of the so-called <i>style troubadour</i> turned inside out. Much the
same may be said for the block of flats built by Édouard Renaud (1808-86), a pupil of
Leroy, at 5 Place St Georges in 1841. But this was rather an exception to the severity and
regularity of Parisian street architecture under the Restoration. This was generally
maintained, moreover, under the July Monarchy for blocks of flats, even by men like
Visconti and Lesueur whose private houses were often very rich indeed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two country houses of 1840 make a more extensive and plausible use of <i>François I</i>
features. One is the Château de St Martin, near St Paulzo in the Nièvre, built by
Édouard Lussy (1788-1868), a pupil of Percier; this is elaborately picturesque in silhouette
but still rigidly symmetrical. Another by J.-B.-P. Canissié (1799-1877), a pupil
of Hittorff, at Draveil, S.-et-O., is somewhat irregular both in plan and in composition.
But the <i>style François I</i> in the France of the second quarter of the nineteenth
century had neither the general acceptance nor even the vitality—at that relatively low—of
the revived ‘Jacobethan’ in contemporary England.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even where a major sixteenth-century monument had to be restored and enlarged,
as was the case with the Hôtel de Ville of Paris, the architects Godde and Lesueur were
at some pains to regularize and chasten the unclassical vagaries of Boccador’s original
design (Plate <a href='#pl022a'>22<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Most of the work by Lesueur was done after 1837; from 1853 Victor
Baltard (1805-74), son of L.-P. Baltard, carried on; then the whole had to be rebuilt
after it was burned under the Commune. The present rather similar edifice by Théodore
Ballu (1817-74), a pupil of Lebas, was begun only in 1874, the year of his death, and
eventually completed by his partner P.-J.-E. Deperthes (1833-98). Except for the high
French roofs, looking forward like those by Gisors on the École Normale to the next
period, the general effect of Lesueur’s work here was very Italianate.</p>

<p class='c010'>A somewhat similar character can be seen in a few wholly new structures of more or
less <i>François I</i> inspiration, for example the Museum and Library at Le Havre built by
C.-L.-F. Brunet-Debaines (1801-62), a pupil of Vaudoyer and Lebas, in 1845. In such a
major commercial work of this period as the Galeries du Commerce et de l’Industrie in
the Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, built by J.-L.-V. Grisart (1797-1877), a pupil of Huyot,
and C.-M.-A. Froehlicher in 1838, it is hard to say whether the continuous arcading
derived from French or from Italian sixteenth-century precedent. The iron-and-glass
interiors were of more interest (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>There has seemed no need to emphasize thus far, as regards its effect on architecture,
the change of regime that took place in 1830, even though that date in the other arts of
France is sometimes thought to mark the triumph of <i>romantisme de la lettre</i> over earlier
Neo-Classicism. No such triumph took place in architecture, although it is evident
that sources of inspiration other than the Antique were rather more frequently utilized
after 1830 than before, if to nothing like the same extent as in Germany. Yet thanks to
Victor Hugo and Guizot, Gothicism had by now acquired a less reactionary connotation
than under the last Bourbons and was receiving the support, up to a point, of the
July Monarchy (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>For political reasons Louis Philippe desired especially to emphasize the continuity of
his liberal monarchy with the more liberal aspects of the Empire and to reclaim for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>France the Napoleonic glories that the Restoration had denigrated. So Napoleon’s ashes
were brought back to the Invalides, where Visconti, hitherto chiefly active in the domestic
field, prepared in 1842 a setting for them as funereal as the Chapelle Expiatoire but
more sumptuous in its use of coloured marbles. Napoleon’s Temple de la Gloire (the
Madeleine) and his Arc de Triomphe de l’Étoile were finally brought to completion,
the one by Huvé in 1845, the other by Blouet in 1837, as has already been noted.
Several new monuments, very much of the Empire type, were also erected in Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where Napoleon’s Elephant Monument was to have marked the site of the Bastille,
J.-A. Alavoine (1778-1834), and after his death L.-J. Duc (1802-79), a pupil of Percier,
erected in 1831-40 the gigantic Colonne de Juillet, rather less Imperial Roman and more
French Empire than Napoleon’s Colonne Vendôme, but like that all of metal. In the
centre of the Place de la Concorde there rose, with echoes of Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign
(and less relevantly of Sixtine Rome), a real obelisk presented to Louis Philippe
by the Khedive in 1833; thereafter, Hittorff ornamented in 1836-40 the square, the
Champs Élysées, the Place de l’Étoile, and the Avenue de la Grande Armée with big
fountains, lamp standards, and other pieces of elaborate urbanistic furniture.</p>

<p class='c010'>While the Empire embellishment of Paris was thus finished up or complemented, the
July Monarchy also developed a fantastically extensive activity in the construction of
hospitals, prisons, and other such utilitarian structures. Vast and plain, these could
hardly be duller in the eyes of posterity. Yet they derive quite directly from Durand’s
admirable paradigms for such structures and more remotely from the social, if not the
aesthetic, aspirations of such men of high talent as Ledoux and Boullée, who initiated
Romantic Classicism before the Revolution. If a funerary edifice—the Chapelle Expiatoire—best
epitomizes the architecture of the Restoration, some enormous public
institution is the contemporary, if inappropriate, architectural equivalent of the Romantic
arts of Delacroix and Berlioz in the thirties and forties! Very conspicuous, and quite
characteristic of these as a class, is the Hôtel Dieu, beside Notre-Dame in Paris, although
this was actually built<a id="r66"></a><a href='#f66' class='c025'><sup>[66]</sup></a> very much later, in 1864-78, by A.-N. Diet (1827-90). It is the
only one that can be readily seen without being jailed or certified; but most of them
were amply presented in contemporary publications.</p>

<p class='c010'>Penchaud, whose Marseilles Protestant church has already been mentioned, was one
of the ablest and most productive provincial architects of the Restoration and Louis
Philippe periods. His lazaret at Marseilles, built in 1822-6, is more Ledoux-like than
the Aix Palace of Justice that he erected on Ledoux’s foundations and considerably more
original than his triumphal arch of 1823-32 at Marseilles, called the Porte d’Aix. On
this arch, however, the liveliness of the relief sculpture provides something of the same
Romantic <i>élan</i> as that of Rude on the Arc de l’Étoile—Rude’s work dates, of course,
from the Louis Philippe period. The Marseilles arch continues the Roman ideals of the
Empire; the more significant lazaret revives the social and utilitarian ideals of the
preceding Revolutionary period.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Paris Lebas’s Petite Roquette Prison for young criminals, in the Rue de la Roquette,
designed in 1825 and executed with some modification of the original project in 1831-6,
hardly rivals his great church in interest; but the polygonal plan with machicolated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>round towers at the corners recalls both the special medievalism of Boullée and the Millbank
Penitentiary<a id="r67"></a><a href='#f67' class='c025'><sup>[67]</sup></a> in London of 1812-21 which Lebas had actually visited. Of more
historical significance was the no longer extant Prison de la Nouvelle Force (or Mazas)
commissioned in 1836 and built in 1843-50 by E.-J. Gilbert (1793-1874), a pupil first of
Durand at the École Polytechnique and then of Vignon, the recognized leader in this
field under Louis Philippe. Its radial cellular planning showed, like Barry’s Pentonville
Prison of 1841-2 in London, the significant influence abroad of the Eastern Penitentiary
in Philadelphia built by John Haviland (1792-1852) in 1823-35. This plan was made
known to Europeans by two reports on American prisons, one by William Crawford,
published in London in 1834, and another by F.-A. Demetz and Blouet, published in
Paris in 1837. On this prison J.-F.-J. Lecointe (1783-1858) was associated with Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>Much larger is Gilbert’s Charenton Lunatic Asylum of 1838-45 at St Maurice outside
Paris, which he designed and built alone. The vast and orderly grid of this institution
provides a community that is almost of the order of a complete town. The innumerable
bare and regular ranges of wards are dominated by the temple portico of the centrally
placed chapel, an ecclesiastical monument of some distinction that is unfortunately inaccessible
to visitors. Such work, often as extensive in the provinces as near the capital,
was much admired and studied by foreigners even quite late in the century. To the
French, moreover, it carried a special prestige; the line of descent was direct from
Boullée to Durand and from Durand to Gilbert and his provincial rivals, such as the
brothers Douillard (L.-P., 1790-1869; L.-C., 1795-1878, a pupil of Crucy), who were
responsible for the Hospice Général (Saint-Jacques) at Nantes built in 1832-6 (Plate <a href='#pl020'>20</a>).
In the estimation of contemporaries, this was one of the two main lines of development
in this period, balancing socially and intellectually the more aesthetic programme of
polychromatic romanticization pursued by Hittorff, Henri Labrouste, and Duban.</p>

<p class='c010'>Representational public buildings, although usually much less plain in design, are
likely to be even more heavy-handed than the prisons and lunatic asylums. Their architects’
strictly functional approach was capable of achieving a rather bleak sort of distinction
which should have been sympathetic to the twentieth century had they been better
known. The Palace of Justice at Tours of 1840-50 by Charles Jacquemin-Belisle (1815-69),
with its unpedimented Roman Doric portico, is typical enough of a very considerable
number of large and prominent civic structures. Lequeux’s Paris town halls in the
outlying <i>arrondissements</i> are just as dry but less monumentally Classical.</p>

<p class='c010'>Happily there are a few finer public buildings, mostly in Paris, structures not least
interesting for their bold use of metal and glass. Among early railway stations only the
Gare Montparnasse of 1848-52 by V.-B. Lenoir (1805-63) and the engineer Eugène
Flachat (1802-73) and the Gare de Strasbourg (Gare de l’Est) of 1847-52 by F.-A. Duquesney
(1790-1849), a pupil of Percier, still stand in Paris. The Gare de l’Est, with its vast
central lunette expressing clearly the iron-and-glass arched train-shed, is a most notable
early station. The detailing, of a somewhat High Renaissance—at least not Greek or
Roman—order, is pleasant but undistinguished (Plate <a href='#pl022b'>22<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This detailing has been
effectively maintained in the modern doubling of the front of the station. The original
shed by the engineer Sérinet was long ago replaced.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The other great Parisian structure of the forties in whose
construction the visible use of iron played a prominent part, the
Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in the Place du Panthéon, is especially
distinguished for the originality and elegance of its detailing, even
more as regards that of the masonry of the exterior than of the
ironwork within (Plate <a href='#pl021'>21</a>). Henri-P.-F. Labrouste (1801-75), a pupil
of Lebas and Vaudoyer, who designed this library in 1839 and built it
in 1843-50, is the one French architect of the age whose name can be
mentioned—though a little diffidently—with those of the great
architects of the earlier decades of the century outside France, Soane
and Schinkel, even if his contemporaries usually gave precedence to
Gilbert or to Hittorff. Yet Labrouste hardly ranks for quality with a
Dane of his own generation such as Bindesbøll, although his library is
much more advanced both stylistically and technically than the
contemporary Thorwaldsen Museum in Copenhagen.</p>

<p class='c010'>Everywhere except in England this was a period, like the first quarter of the century,
in which official architecture exceeded private in interest. Moreover, the priority that the
erection of monuments of public utility, from markets and prisons to art galleries and
libraries, received over the building of churches and palaces gave significant evidence
of the rise of a new pattern of bourgeois culture. It is therefore quite appropriate that this
library of Henri Labrouste’s should be the finest structure of the forties in France. The
Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève is also one of the few buildings of the second quarter
century anywhere in the world that has been almost universally admired ever since its
completion, if successively for a variety of different reasons. The façade of the library,
often ignored by those praising the visible iron structure of the interior (Figure <a href='#i125'>14</a>), outranks
in distinction almost all other contemporary examples of the Renaissance Revival
anywhere in the world; but it is worth noting that the flanking administrative block
and the Collège Sainte-Barbe also offer a premonition of the next period in their prominent
mansard roofs. (Henri’s brother F.-M.-T. Labrouste (1799-1855) supervised the
construction of the college.) The façade of Henri’s administrative block is a composition
of real originality and exquisite co-ordination of parts to which the term Renaissance
Revival need hardly be applied; this is what <i>style Louis Philippe</i> really means, or ought
at least to mean.</p>

<p class='c010'>By Charles X’s time the Salle des Cinq Cents at the Palais Bourbon, erected by the
two older Gisors and Leconte in the 1790s, was in such a bad state that it was necessary
to rebuild it, adding at the same time a library. J.-J.-B. de Joly (1788-1865) in 1828-33
followed closely the original design; but behind the scenes, as it were, he used a great
deal of iron to ensure a lasting structure. He also embellished the walls with a richly
coloured sheathing of French marbles and, in the library, with murals by Delacroix.
With less originality, but with respect for a major monument of the seventeenth century,
H.-A.-G. de Gisors much enlarged the Luxembourg for Louis Philippe in 1834-41, repeating
Salomon de Brosse’s original garden façade, in order to accommodate a new
chamber for the House of Peers. His chamber followed closely the earlier one there of
1798 by Chalgrin; the new chapel which he also provided at the Luxembourg has even
more of the colouristic richness demanded by advanced taste in this period. The Luxembourg
Orangery, later the Luxembourg Museum, which was built by Gisors in 1840 in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>an early seventeenth-century mode, used brick for the walls with only the dressings of
stone, a rare instance of such external bichromy in the Paris of its day despite the lively
interest in the employment of colour in architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The present Foreign Ministry on the Quai d’Orsay was built in 1846-56 by Jacques
Lacornée (1779-1856), who had completed in 1821-35 his master Bonnard’s earlier
Ministry near by that was begun for Napoleon in 1814. Superimposed arch orders produce
a rich and rather Venetian version of the Renaissance Revival not unrelated to the
treatment of the somewhat exceptional Empire building on which he had worked. Duc
began to plan the restoration and enlargement of the Palace of Justice in Paris as
early as 1840, but the handsomest and most conspicuous portions of this elaborate complex
date from the Second Empire. J.-F. Duban (1797-1870) started the restoration of
the old Louvre, over which a hot controversy soon ensued, in 1848; the New Louvre,
begun by Visconti in 1852 and carried forward after his death in 1853 by Lefuel,
would be the prime monument of the succeeding period (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>). Duban’s
capacities in this period—he did his best work rather later (Plate <a href='#pl072b'>72<span class='fss'>B</span></a>)—are better appreciated
in the building for the École des Beaux Arts he completed in 1838 and in the
elegant Early Italian Renaissance design of the Hôtel de Pourtalès of 1836 in the Rue
Tronchet, perhaps the finest Paris mansion of its day.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, it was not with such <i>hôtels particuliers</i> but with <i>maisons de rapport</i>, that is,
blocks of flats, that the streets of Paris, like those of Berlin and Vienna, were mostly
built up in these decades. Earlier ones, such as those in the Place de la Bourse, are very
carefully composed yet almost devoid of prominent architectural features
(Plate <a href='#pl027c'>27<span class='fss'>C</span></a>).
In the later thirties and above all the forties, however, the detail grew richer and more
eclectic, while the façades were in general much less neatly composed. Not
only were rich Italian or French Renaissance features popular but exotic oriental ornament
was more than occasionally used. The planning became more complex and elastic
also; but both in exterior design and in interior organization the type remained firmly
rooted in late-eighteenth-century tradition. The Paris streets of the first half of the nineteenth
century have a notable consistency of scale and character, since the cornice lines,
and even the shapes of the high roofs, were controlled by a well-enforced building code
and their eclecticism of style is little more than a matter of detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>More than in other countries in this period, the major virtues of
French architecture lay in the placid continuance of well-established
lines. Traditions were being slowly eroded, but there was very little
of that urgent desire to overturn the immediate past which coloured so
significantly much English production of the thirties and forties. Nor
was there the German capacity in this period for carrying over into
medievalizing modes the basic discipline of established Romantic
Classicism. Not surprisingly, French leadership in architecture,
established under Louis XIV and renewed under Napoleon, was largely
lost; it came back, however, with the Second Empire
(see Chapters <a href='#ch08'>8</a> and <a href='#ch09'>9</a>). All the same, architectural
controversy flourished at home in these decades.</p>

<p class='c010'>Quite naturally, French influence still remained largely dominant in contiguous
Belgium and much of Switzerland. If Studer’s work in Berne falls under the German
rubric of <i>Rundbogenstil</i>, in French-speaking Lausanne and Neuchâtel important commissions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>went to Frenchmen. An Asylum for the former city was designed by Henri
Labrouste in 1837-8; another in the latter town, built a few years later, is by P.-F.-N.
Philippon (1784-1866), a pupil of J.-J. Ramée who had also worked with Brongniart.
Both are characteristically respectable examples of <i>Louis Philippe</i> work. Labrouste also
designed a prison for Alessandria in Italy in 1840.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Belgium, under Dutch rule from the fall of Napoleon down to 1830, the Théâtre
de la Monnaie in Brussels, begun in 1819 by the French architect L.-E.-A. Damesme
(1757-1822), who had once worked on the Paris <i>barrières</i> with Ledoux, and completed
by E.-J. Bonnevie (1783-1835), is a large but typical example of the theatres built in the
French provinces by architects of the previous generation. It was not improved by an
enlargement and remodelling of 1856, but the original temple portico is noble in scale
and handsomely detailed. Characteristically, Damesme also built the Brussels prison.
When a new generation of Belgian architects appeared led by Joseph Poelaert (1817-79),
who had studied with Huyot, more international influences were evident. For
example, Poelaert’s fine early school of 1852 in the Rue de Schaerbeek in Brussels shows
little of Huyot but a good deal of Schinkel in its rationalistic handling of Grecian forms.
Poelaert’s boldness here, which even suggests that of Alexander Thomson in his Glasgow
work of this decade and the next, prepares one a little for his later Palace of Justice
designed in the sixties (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The long pre-eminence of Italy in the arts came to an end even before the end of the
old regime. Architects still flocked there, finding in each generation new sources of inspiration
as first Renaissance palaces and then medieval churches succeeded Roman ruins
as the preferred quarry of travellers of taste. But not after Piranesi was there an Italian
architect with real international influence. At the opening of the new century doctrine
flowed from Paris, not from Rome; increasingly, moreover, architects turned to England
and Germany for still fresher ideas and ideals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only a few Italian cities were notably ornamented in this period; on the other hand,
none were blighted, and much ordinary building hardly even bears clear indications of
its date. The characteristic and prominent productions of the period are, however, quite
up to the highest international standards. They have thus far been underestimated, not
least by the Italians themselves, partly because they are so much overshadowed in interest
by earlier work, partly because they carry in Italy for the first time since the Gothic
the onus—not entirely justified—of following a foreign lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pope, like other legitimate sovereigns who returned to power after Napoleon’s
fall, carried out existing projects, notably those for the Piazza del Popolo as planned by
Valadier. He also initiated in 1817 the building of a new wing for the sculpture museum
at the Vatican, the Braccio Nuovo by Raffaelle Stern (1774-1820). Completed in
1821, this is one of the finest of the many galleries in the line of descent from Simonetti’s
Museo Pio-Clementino at the Vatican of which the first half of the nineteenth
century saw so many (Plate <a href='#pl024'>24</a>). Taller and less ornately embellished than Klenze’s
galleries in the Munich Glyptothek, and with rather stronger spatial articulation, this
is none the less well within the Romantic Classical tradition as it had been established
by the previous generation of French architects.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>The principal architectural activity of the post-Napoleonic years in Rome and, indeed,
of the whole later period of papal rule was the reconstruction after a fire of the
great fifth-century basilica of San Paolo fuori-le-mura. Begun by Pasquale Belli (1752-1833)
in 1825, with whom were associated the younger Pietro Camporesi (1792-1873)
and F. J. Bosio (1768-1845), the supervision was taken over after Belli’s death in 1833
by Luigi Poletti (1792-1869), who completed the job in 1856. Following closely the
august original in its dimensions and proportions, San Paolo has a truly Roman Imperial
scale; but the hardness of the materials, the polish of their surfaces, and the cold precision
of their handling recalls rather the contemporary Paris churches of Lebas and
Hittorff without matching their relatively rich colour. A more modest Roman monument
of this period in a conspicuous location is the Teatro Argentina by Camporesi.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Teatro Carlo Felice in the Piazza de Ferrari in Genoa, built by C. F. Barabino
(1768-1835) in 1827, is a more advanced and distinguished Romantic Classical structure
of considerable originality, now badly damaged by bombing. Barabino was also responsible
for designing the Camposanto di Staglieno at Genoa with its Pantheon-like chapel
and its endless colonnades. Begun in 1835, this project was carried to completion by
G. B. Rezasco (1799-1872).</p>

<p class='c010'>Naples<a id="r68"></a><a href='#f68' class='c025'><sup>[68]</sup></a> has more interesting monuments of this period to offer than Rome or
Genoa. Yet San Francesco di Paola, which was built from designs by Pietro Bianchi
(1787-1849) in 1816-24 in resolution of a vow of Ferdinand I, can hardly be considered
much more original than San Paolo (Plate <a href='#pl026a'>26<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The interior is another of the innumerable
copies of the Pantheon that were erected all over Europe and America in this
period; but the Berninian quadrant colonnades in front are better handled than at
Voronikhin’s Kazan Cathedral at Petersburg. The great saucer dome, moreover, is rather
happily echoed in the two smaller domes on either side; they serve also to tie together
the side colonnades and the pedimented portico. Above all, this church is most effective
urbanistically. The colonnades enclose the square north of the Royal Palace in a quite
Baroque way; while the church as a whole, because of the giant scale of its parts and its
cleanly sculptural composition, stands as a discrete object in the best Romantic Classical
way against the higher portion of the city that rises behind. Less happy in the city picture
is the front of the San Carlo opera house, carried out a little earlier in 1810-12 by
Antonio Niccolini (1772-1850), who also redecorated the interior in 1816-17 and again in
1841-4. This has adequate open space only at the sides; and the curiously high-waisted
façade, in any case rather underscaled in its parts, must be seen in a perspective sharper
than is becoming to most post-Baroque monuments (Plate <a href='#pl023b'>23<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The throne room in the palace at nearby Caserta, decorated for Ferdinand II by
Gaetano Genovese (1795-1860) in 1839-45, is a surprisingly worthy late pendant to de
Simone’s contiguous interiors of more than a generation earlier, very rich indeed in its
gold-and-white decoration, but superbly ordered. Genovese also carried out an extensive
and tactful remodelling and enlargement of the Royal Palace in Naples in 1837-44,
most notably the regularization of the long façade above the quay.</p>

<p class='c010'>No other Italian city provides quite such prominent examples of individual Romantic
Classical monuments as do Rome and Naples. The setting of San Carlo in Milan, built
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>by Carlo Amati (1776-1852) in 1844-7, a rectangular recession from the line of the
present-day Corso Matteotti, provides no such build-up for its Pantheon-like dome as
does Bianchi’s San Francesco. The giant granite colonnades at the base of the contiguous
blocks do, however, continue effectively the pedimented portico on either side of the
little <i>piazza</i>. Only at Turin, almost more French than Italian always, were great squares
and wide, arcaded streets carried out in this period, but without focal monuments of any
particular distinction. These squares and streets vie with Percier and Fontaine’s in Paris,
yet they also continue a local seventeenth-century tradition that was to remain alive
down into the Fascist period.</p>

<p class='c010'>The expiatory church in Turin, which paralleled in motivation Ferdinand I’s in
Naples, the Gran Madre di Dio, was proposed in 1814 and built on the farther bank of
the Po by Ferdinando Bonsignore (1767-1843) in 1818-31 to celebrate the departure of
the French and the return of the House of Savoy to its capital (Plate <a href='#pl026b'>26<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This is a far
duller and less original example of a modern structure based directly on the Pantheon
than is the Tempio Canoviano of 1819-20 at Possagno.<a id="r69"></a><a href='#f69' class='c025'><sup>[69]</sup></a> For this the great Romantic
Classical sculptor of Italy, Thorvaldsen’s rival Antonio Canova, was the client and
apparently also the designer.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not Bonsignore’s church that is notable in the Turin scene but the vast Piazza
Vittorio Veneto opposite, laid out by Giuseppe Frizzi (1797-1831) in 1818 and later
surrounded by fine ranges of arcaded buildings mostly carried out between 1825 and 1830
(Plate <a href='#pl026b'>26<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). At the upper end of this tremendous square two quadrants draw in to meet
the arcaded Via Po. Characteristically, the arcades here are supported on compound piers
based on those in the seventeenth-century Piazza San Carlo but simplified and sharpened
now to conform to Romantic Classical standards. Also a typical Turin feature, but
new in this period, was the syncopation of the handsome iron balconies of the upper
storeys. This theme marks most of the houses in the quarter contiguous to this square,
a quarter built up over the next generation in a remarkably elegant and consistent way
more than rivalling the contemporary districts of Paris or Vienna.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other principal square of this period, on the farther side of the new quarter and
at the outer end of the present-day Via Roma, is the Piazza Carlo Felice. This was laid
out by the engineer Lombardi and by Frizzi in 1823, and has façades by Carlo Promis
(1808-73) that also extend on both sides of the square along the broad Corso Vittorio
Emmanuele II. Continuous arcades cross the street ends, as in the Piazza Vittorio Veneto,
and the balconies are syncopated. The fine big trees in the square and along the Corso
are a happy addition to the urban scene quite uncharacteristic of the rest of Italy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inner end of the Piazza Carlo Felice is not curved but semi-octagonal. Originally
the outer end was open and defined only by rows of trees; later, in 1866-8, the handsome
Porta Nuova Railway Station was built there by the engineer Alessandro Mazzuchetti
(1824-94) and the architect Carlo Ceppi (1829-1921). Now this terminates the
long central axis of the city which extends from the Royal Palace through the Piazza
Castello, the Piazza San Carlo, and down the Via Roma to the Piazza Carlo Felice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Turin has other monumental edifices of this period besides the Gran Madre di Dio.
There are, for example, two later churches in the new quarter, San Massimo and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Sacramentine; the latter, by Alfonso Dupuy, was built in 1846-50 from a design of 1843,
with later portico by Ceppi; the former in 1845-54 by Carlo Sada (1809-73). Both are
domed, but less Pantheon-like than the Gran Madre. They lack, unfortunately, the elegance
and delicacy of scale of the houses of the period in the streets that surround them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Milan owes less than Turin to the architectural activity of this period. The present
decoration of the interior of the opera-house, La Scala, which was built by Giuseppe
Piermarini (1734-1808) in 1776-8, dates from 1830 and is by Alessandro Sanquirico
(1774-1849). This is quite similar in the sumptuousness of its white-and-gold ornamentation
to Genovese’s later throne room at Caserta. The square gatehouses at the
Porta Venezia, built in 1826 by Rodolfo Vantini (1791-1856), are boldly scaled and
effectively paired. The Palazzo Rocca-Saporiti of 1812 by Giovanni Perego (1776-1817)
in the Corso Venezia with its raised colonnade rivals in interest Cantoni’s better-known
Palazzo Serbelloni of the 1790s near by. The much smaller and considerably
later Palazzo Lucini of 1831 in the Via Monte di Pietà by Ferdinando Crivelli (1810-55)
is so expert an example of High Renaissance design that it can readily be taken for real
<i>cinquecento</i> work. Paradoxically, such an extremely literate specimen of the Renaissance
Revival is far less characteristic of Italy in the second quarter of the nineteenth century
than of England or Germany. More typical of Italian taste in the thirties and forties
are the buildings facing the flank of La Scala across the Via Verdi with their complex
rhythm of fenestration and their very rich but still vaguely Grecian ornamentation.
Eventually the Italians did, however, take up occasionally the Renaissance version of the
international <i>Rundbogenstil</i>, and none too happily. For example, the Casa di Risparmio
(known vulgarly as the Ca’ de Sass), built by Giuseppe Balzaretti (1801-74) in 1872
across the street from the refined and discreet Palazzo Lucini, is a stonier example of
Tuscan rustication—as its nickname suggests—than was ever produced by the Northern
Europeans who first revived the mode half a century earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>A charming ornament to a smaller city is the Caffè Pedrocchi<a id="r70"></a><a href='#f70' class='c025'><sup>[70]</sup></a> in Padua of 1816-31
by Giuseppe Jappelli (1783-1852), a pupil of Selva, and Antonio Gradenigo (1806-84).
Delicate in scale, interestingly varied in the handling of solids and voids, and most
urbane in the discretion of its carefully placed ornamentation, this is certainly the handsomest
nineteenth-century café in the world and about the finest Romantic Classical
edifice in Italy (Plate <a href='#pl023a'>23<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Exceptional in this period in the Latin world is the Neo-Gothic
wing known as Il Pedrocchino attached to the café, designed by Jappelli and for
the same client; this was completed in 1837.</p>

<p class='c010'>Trieste in this period, like the cities of Lombardy and the Veneto, is more Italian than
Austrian architecturally. As a result it outshines Vienna in the extent and the quality of
its early nineteenth-century construction. The new buildings were largely concentrated
around the Canal Grande, a rectangular lagoon extending inland from the Riva Tre
Novembre. At the head of this rises Sant’ Antonio di Padova, built by Nobile in 1826-49,
long after this former Trieste City Architect had been called to Vienna as head of
the architecture section of the Akademie there. Occupying a position somewhat similar
to that of the Gran Madre di Dio in Turin, Nobile’s church is considerably more interesting,
particularly as regards the generous spatial organization of the interior. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Canal Grande is flanked by contemporary palaces that are harmonious with one another
in scale but quite varied in detail. The largest and finest, facing the sea on the left, is the
Palazzo Carciotti. This was completed in 1806 by Matthäus Pertsch, a Milan-trained
architect who had provided in 1798 the façade of the Teatro Verdi here in Trieste. With
its raised portico and small dome, the Palazzo Carciotti is one of the most prominent
and successful Italian buildings of the opening years of the century.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the other side of the Latin world, the Iberian peninsula participated rather less than
the Italian in the advanced architectural movements of the first half of the century.
In Madrid the Obelisk of the 2nd of May, built by Isidro Gonzalez Velasquez
(1764/5-?) in 1822-40, and the Obelisk of La Castellana (1883), by Francisco Javier
de Mariateguí, are rather modest specimens of a widely popular sort of erection compared
to Smirke’s gigantic Wellington Testimonial in Dublin or Mills’s Washington
Monument. The Palace of the Congress of 1843-50 by Narciso Pascual y Coloner
(1808-70) is a dull example of that nineteenth-century Classicism that hardly deserves
the qualification ‘Romantic’.</p>

<p class='c010'>Italians, little employed elsewhere out of their own country in this period, provided
the principal new public edifices of Lisbon. F. X. Fabri (?-1807) built the Palace of
Arzuda, begun in 1802, and Fortunato Lodi (1806-?) the Garret Theatre more than a
generation later in 1842-6; both are as uninspired as the contemporary monuments of
Madrid. As late as 1867-75 the Municipal Chamber of Lisbon by the local architect
Domingos Ponente da Silva (1836-1901) maintained the Classical mode at its most conventional.
Already, with the establishment of the Braganza headquarters in Rio de Janeiro
early in the century, Portuguese vitality was passing to the New World (see Chapter <a href='#ch05'>5</a>).
Yet if Lisbon has no individual Romantic Classical monuments of much interest, the
lower city, extending from the Praça do Commercio to O Rocio, is a splendid example
of late-eighteenth-century urbanism, initiated after the earthquake of 1755 by Eugenio
dos Santos de Carvalho (1711-60).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the eighteenth century Petersburg owed its grandeur as a Baroque city largely to
the work of imported Italian architects; but with the rise of French and English influence
in the later decades of the old century and the first of the new the day of the
Italians was over, there as elsewhere (see Chapter <a href='#ch01'>1</a>). Alexander I’s aspirations, after as
well as before Waterloo, were wholly French, not Italian. The Committee for Construction
and Hydraulic Works, indeed, which Alexander set up in 1816 to pass the designs
of all public and private buildings in his capital, had a French military engineer, General
Béthencourt, as its chairman. Yet the principal architect of the post-Napoleonic decades,
Karl Ivanovich Rossi (1775-1849), although he had an Italian family name and was of
Italian origin, was Russian-born and Russian-trained. Rossi’s General Staff Arches of
1819-29 and the vast hemicycle of which they are the centre continue happily the
urbanistic tradition of the older generation; but the detail is Roman not Greek, and the
taste altogether coarser and more provincial than that of Thomon and Zakharov
(Plate <a href='#pl027b'>27<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This is even more true of his Alexandra Theatre of 1827-32 and his Senate
and Synod of 1829-34.</p>

<p class='c010'>August Augustovich Monferran (1786-1858), to whom was assigned the building of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>St Isaac’s Cathedral<a id="r71"></a><a href='#f71' class='c025'><sup>[71]</sup></a> in 1817, a vast pile that he completed only in 1857 (Plate <a href='#pl027a'>27<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), was
French, despite the Russian form in which his name is here given, and actually a pupil
of Percier. In his youth he had worked under Vignon on the Madeleine, moreover.
Monferran lacked, like most of his own generation who remained in France, both the
originality and the finesse of the earlier generation, just as Nicholas I lacked the taste of
his brother Alexander I. A wealth of sumptuous materials, granites and marbles, marks
this church, however, and the dome is of some importance in technical history because it
is entirely framed in iron (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Another typical monument in the Napoleonic tradition rose also from Monferran’s
designs, the Alexander Column of 1829 in the Winter Palace Square (Plate <a href='#pl027b'>27<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This
may well be the largest granite monolith in the world—a typically Russian claim—but
it quite lacks the elegance of Alavoine’s still later Colonne de Juillet in Paris or the
scale of Mills’s Washington Monument. The Triumphal Gate of 1833 by Vasili Petrovich
Stasov (1769-1848) is a trabeated Greek Doric propylaeon, somewhat comparable to
Nobile’s Burgtor in Vienna; more significant is the fact that, like the July Column in
Paris and Monferran’s great dome, not to speak of a curious Egyptian suspension bridge
of this period in Petersburg, this structure is all of metal.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1840 the authority of the Committee of 1816 was terminated and in Petersburg, as
so generally elsewhere in Europe, coherent urbanistic control came to an end. The great
architectural period there was over as Moscow, with its nationalistic traditions, came
more to the fore. Characteristically, the most important new church of the second
quarter of the century, the Cathedral of the Redeemer of 1839-83, was built in the older
capital and is the first major Russian example of Neo-Byzantine. One is not surprised to
find that Konstantin Andreevich Ton (1794-1881), its architect, was German not
French; for in a sense this represents a rather clumsy local variant of the German <i>Rundbogenstil</i>,
continuing the particular eclectic line initiated by Klenze in his Munich Court
Church more than a decade earlier.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>In</span> English terminology, the most productive period of Nash and Soane, the two
greatest Romantic Classical architects of England, extending from 1810 down to the
thirties, is loosely referred to as ‘Regency’, and the rest of the first half of the century as
‘Early Victorian’. Neither term has much more specific meaning in an international
frame of reference than does ‘Restoration’ or ‘Louis Philippe’ in France, not to speak
of ‘Biedermeier’, which is sometimes used for this period in Germany and Austria.
‘Regency’ production includes the characteristic monuments of mature Romantic
Classicism in England and also much work that makes manifest the Picturesque point
of view. Early Victorian production illustrates the modulation of Romantic Classicism
into the Renaissance Revival, and includes as well the most doctrinaire phase of the
Gothic Revival (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>).</p>
<p class='c010'>Although current researches are somewhat amending the picture, it is accepted that
private architecture has generally been more significant in England than public architecture.
This was least true in the first three decades of the nineteenth century. Soane
had been Architect to the Bank of England, in effect if not in fact an important branch
of the State, from 1788. Nash succeeded Wyatt in the office of Surveyor-General—although
he was only given the title of Deputy—in 1813. And in 1815 Soane, Nash, and
Smirke, undoubtedly the three leading architects of their day if one excepts Wilkins,
became the members of a new board set up by the national Office of Works, which
was at a peak of its authority and activity immediately after Napoleon’s downfall.
Soane and Smirke, though not personal favourites of George IV, were knighted, like
several of their German contemporaries. The principal building project of the day, the
laying out and the construction of Regent Street and Regent’s Park, the latter on Crown
land, had the fullest personal support of George IV, first as Regent and after 1820 as
King.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet Soane’s most important work between 1810 and 1818 was private, except for
what he built as Architect to the Chelsea Hospital, and, in the case of his house and his
family tomb, wholly personal. All that remains of consequence of his work at the Chelsea
Hospital, the stables of 1814-17, might as well be private, for this is no great monument
with columned portico and Pantheon-dome such as preoccupied most architects of
Soane’s generation and status abroad (Plate <a href='#pl028a'>28<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Rigidly astylar, boldly arcuated, and
executed in common yellowish London stock bricks, with no more deference to the
purplish walling bricks and bright orange-red rubbed dressings of Wren’s earlier buildings
at the Hospital than to his English Baroque style, this is as utilitarian as any project of
Durand’s. Moreover, in its very simple detailing this reflects, and quite consciously,
something of that primitivistic aspect of international Romantic Classical theory deriving
from the theories of Soane’s favourite critical author, Laugier. Above all, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>proportioning and in the organization of the arcuated elements, the design of the stables
is personal almost to the point of perversity. It is far more comprehensible to the abstract
tastes of the twentieth century than in accordance with the ideals most widely accepted
in the England of Soane’s own day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soane’s Dulwich Gallery of 1811-14, outside London, is likewise built of common
brick and has similarly primitivistic detailing. This structure is most characteristic of its
period in being a museum, indeed it is the earliest nineteenth-century example; but it
could hardly be more different from the line of sculpture galleries that runs from
Klenze’s Glyptothek in Munich through Bindesbøll’s Thorwaldsen Museum in Copenhagen.
Nor does it much resemble the picture galleries of the period running from those
in Schinkel’s Altes Museum in Berlin through Klenze’s Ältere Pinakothek in Munich to
Voit’s Neuere Pinakothek, also in Munich. It is least unlike the last of these, although
that was designed forty years later; this similarity may help to suggest how confusingly
advanced in style Soane, eldest of the leading architects of the post-Napoleonic decades,
remained even in middle and old age.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Soane’s <i>Rundbogenstil</i>—so to apply this term out of its German context, as one
might do even more properly to the Chelsea Hospital stables—is a round-arched style
with a difference. There are neither medieval nor <i>quattrocento</i> Italian overtones here.
While Soane’s approach was creatively personal in the detailing as well as in the over-all
organization, that approach seems most closely parallel to Durand’s rationalism, particularly
in the technical skill with which the monitor-lighting was handled. The centrepiece
of the Gallery is a mausoleum in which Soane’s virtuosity in three-dimensional
composition—an interest that sets him well apart from most of his generation on the
Continent—and also at abstract linear ornamentation, produced here by plain incisions
in the stone slabs of the lantern, reaches something of a climax.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even more of such ornamentation is to be seen on the family tomb in St Pancras
churchyard of 1816 as also, though much more chastely handled, on the façade of his
own house<a id="r72"></a><a href='#f72' class='c025'><sup>[72]</sup></a> of 1812-13 at 13 Lincoln’s Inn Fields. The interiors of this house are full of
spatial exercises, many of them miniscule in scale, which Soane developed later in
various public structures. It may suffice here to mention the small breakfast-room with
its very shallow dome, its varied and ingenious effects of indirect lighting, and its characteristic
decoration by means of incised linear patterns and convex mirrors.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1818 there began for Soane a new spate of public activity that continued down to
1823. A series of offices at the Bank of England<a id="r73"></a><a href='#f73' class='c025'><sup>[73]</sup></a> now carried further the spatial and
decorative innovations of the interiors of the 1790s. Whether or not these were finer is a
matter of taste; but the continuous arched forms without imposts, the smoother surfaces,
and the very abstract linear decoration certainly represent a more advanced stage of
Soane’s personal style (Plate <a href='#pl028b'>28<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Under the Act for Building New Churches of 1818,
which generated great activity in the ecclesiastical field, Soane was one of the guiding
architects; he built, however, only three churches for the Commission that was set up by
the Act. St Peter’s, Walworth, in South London, of 1823-5 is both elegant and ingenious
in the way the galleries are incorporated into the internal architectural organization
rather than treated as mere afterthought. The other two are less successful.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Almost all the other churches built under the Act, or by other means, in these years
were rather conventionally Grecian, that is if sufficient funds were available; otherwise
they were what is called ‘Commissioners’ Gothic’ (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>). The contrast
that the former provide with the Walworth church helps to emphasize the highly personal
character of Soane’s achievement even in his least esteemed work. St Peter’s was
evidently designed from the inside out, and owes almost nothing to the architecture of
any period of the past. The type-church of the age in England, however, comparable in
historical significance to Lebas’s slightly later Notre-Dame-de-Lorette in Paris, is St
Pancras of 1818-22 in the Euston Road in London built by William Inwood (<i>c.</i> 1771-1843)
and his son (H. W., 1794-1843). Very evidently this was designed from the
outside in, for its features are derived from the Erechtheum, a monument which the
younger Inwood actually went to Athens to measure after the church had been begun.<a id="r74"></a><a href='#f74' class='c025'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>English tradition required a lantern above the temple portico at the front, and so the
Inwoods devised a sort of Gibbsian tower for St Pancras out of elements borrowed from
the Athenian Tower of the Winds. Urbane yet rather barren, the interior lacks even the
tepid religious feeling of the French basilicas of the day. The architects, and contemporaries
generally, were more interested in the caryatid porches—for there are not one
but two—that flank the rear.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other Inwood churches in London, such as All Saints in Camden Street of 1822-4 and
St Peter’s in Regent’s Square of 1824-6, are equally Greek in detail but less directly
related to particular ancient monuments. They are also much less impressive. No more
interesting are most of the Grecian churches built by other architects. St Mary’s, Wyndham
Place of 1823-4 by Smirke, however, is set apart by the circular tower placed on
the south, a feature which he had already used on St Philip’s, Salford, of 1822-5. His
church at Markham Clinton in Nottinghamshire of 1833, cruciform in plan and with a
fine octagonal lantern, is considerably more original, but it was rather a family mausoleum
than an ordinary parish church.</p>

<p class='c010'>A revolution was getting under way in Great Britain in the realm of church architecture
at this very time, and the heyday of the temple church was destined to be brief.
After the early thirties only Nonconformists continued to build them. But such a Congregational
chapel as that built by F. H. Lockwood (1811-78) and Thomas Allom
(1804-72) in Great Thornton Street, Hull, in 1841-3, its broad temple front flanked by
lower side wings, still had real distinction, a distinction rarely maintained after this date,
although rather similar structures continued to be erected for several more decades both
in London and in the provinces.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Scotland, where Greek sanctions lasted longer than in England, Alexander Thomson
(1817-75) built in the fifties and sixties three of the finest Romantic Classical
churches in the world. His Caledonia Road Free Church in Glasgow of 1856-7 was designed
for those Presbyterians who had left the established Scottish church in 1843
(Plate <a href='#pl029'>29</a>). This owes a great deal to Schinkel’s suburban Berlin churches, which Thomson
must have known through the <i>Sammlung architektonischer Entwürfe</i>. The composition
is more Picturesque, in being markedly asymmetrical, and the superb tower at
the corner reduces the temple front to a subordinate element in a sort of Italian Villa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>composition. Yet the idea for this sort of composition may well have come from Schinkel
also, a derivation which the rather <i>Rundbogenstil</i> character and asymmetrical organization
of certain of Thomson’s earlier suburban villas seems to make still more probable. The
interior of the church is very different from that of Soane’s in Walworth, but it is equally
architectonic in the Schinkelesque way the galleries are incorporated in the general
scheme. This is real interior architecture, not just a gallery-surrounded hall like the
Grecian churches in England built back in the twenties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thomson’s more prominently located St Vincent Street Church of 1859, also in Glasgow,
is not finer. But it utilizes a difficult site with striking success, and the exotic eclecticism
of the spire is peculiarly personal to Thomson. His Queen’s Park Church of 1867,
in a southern suburb of Glasgow, was as perversely original as anything by Soane, and
is perhaps Thomson’s final masterpiece. Inside, he handled the light iron supports with
clear logic and elegantly appropriate painted decoration. Both the heavy masonry tower—which
is, of course, invisible from the interior—and the heavy clerestory are carried on
these delicately proportioned metal columns with a frankness and boldness hardly
equalled before the twentieth century. Externally Thomson detailed the trabeated
masonry with the purity of a Schinkel and the originality of a Soane, yet he composed
the façade in three dimensions in a fashion that is almost Baroque beneath his strange
near-Hindu ‘spire’.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thomson’s churches, late though they are, can be better understood as examples of
Romantic Classicism, sharing important qualities with the boldest French projects of the
1780s, than in relation to any other stage of nineteenth-century architectural development.
Yet it will be evident later that they also have a good deal in common with the
architectural aspirations of their own quarter of the century (see Chapter <a href='#ch09'>9</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Soane in his latest work seems at times to have produced what were almost
parodies of his characteristic Bank interiors, approaching in their strangeness and their
oriental allusions the exotic spires of Thomson. As these things do not survive, it is hard
to know whether the Court of Chancery at Westminster of 1824-5, with its pendentives
cut back so that they are no more than a sort of plaster awning, or the Council Chamber
in Freemasons’ Hall, with its strange canopy-like covering, were effective or not. But
these interiors do help to explain why the idiosyncratic, not to say cranky, Soane left on
his death in 1837 no such living tradition behind him as did Schinkel in Germany.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nash, Soane’s rival as England’s leading architect in the second and third decades of
the nineteenth century, was a very different sort of man. Until his marriage he was of no
great prominence; it was the Regent’s favour which then brought him to the fore. As an
urbanist, if not as a designer of individual buildings, he was worthy of his opportunities—and
no architect of his generation had greater. His distinction at what is today called
‘planning’ resides not alone in the amplitude, the elasticity, and the resultant variety of
his schemes, but as much perhaps in his ability as an entrepreneur in carrying amazingly
extensive operations to completion. Few, moreover, succeeded better than Nash in
modulating Romantic Classicism towards the Picturesque; and this was over and above
his important direct contribution to Picturesque practice in the building of castles,
villas, and cottages.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>At the beginning of the second decade of the century the lease of the Crown’s Marylebone
Estate fell in. Nash’s scheme for its development, by far the most comprehensive,
won the day, evidently because he had the personal backing of the Regent. Nash’s
scheme of 1812, somewhat modified in ultimate execution, provided for a park—Regent’s
Park—surrounded by terraces of considerable size organized into a series of
palatial compositions (Figure <a href='#i065'>10</a>). The traditions of homogeneous terrace design go back
to the early eighteenth century, and terraces facing out towards open scenery appeared
soon after the middle of the century. But what Nash planned for Regent’s Park, and in
the main executed, vastly exceeded not only in extent but also in originality the early
eighteenth-century terrace in Grosvenor Square, where the idea of over-all composition
was probably first tried out, or the mid-eighteenth-century Royal Crescent at Bath by
John Wood II (1728-81), which was the first terrace to face not a square or a street but
open park-like country. This work around the park alone should have been enough to
make Nash’s reputation.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in these unquiet years, when the world was briefly trying to live at peace with
Napoleon, Nash sensed the Regent’s ambition to embellish London in a way to rival the
Emperor’s plans for Paris. He therefore projected a street which should proceed, much as
had been proposed even before this, along the line where the residential West End began,
northward from the Regent’s residence at Carlton House to the southern entrance
of the new park. An early scheme for such a street, entirely lined with colonnades and
interrupted by squares in which public structures would stand in splendid isolation, suggests
his original aim of emulating the Rue de Rivoli and Parisian monuments like the
Madeleine and the Bourse. As the project was gradually adjusted to the realities of the
situation, most of its geometric regularity and practically all of its Parisian character disappeared.
The colonnades survived only along the Quadrant leading out of Piccadilly
Circus; the Duke of York’s Column in Waterloo Place, rising between the two blocks
of Carlton House Terrace, which eventually replaced Carlton House, is the one feature
of Napoleonic scale and character. It is not by Nash but by the Duke of York’s favourite
architect, Benjamin Dean Wyatt (1775-?1850), and was built only in 1831-4.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instead of an imitation of Paris, something vastly more original was created, an
example of civic design whose full implications are perhaps not wholly digested even
today. Nash, the former partner of the landscape gardener Humphry Repton (1752-1818),
in his new Regent Street as well as in his Regent’s Park and its surrounding terraces,
sought to carry out, not with natural scenery but with urban scenery, the principles
of Picturesque landscaping. Yet his architectural vocabulary remained well within
the accepted range of Romantic Classicism.</p>

<p class='c010'>Waterloo Place is wholly formal, serving as a sort of forecourt to Carlton House
when it was laid out in 1815. But going up Lower Regent Street the separate buildings
erected in 1817-19 were separately designed, to a harmonious scale but with no over-all
regularity of shape and size. At Piccadilly, first the Circus, also of 1817-19, a circular
place, and then the Quadrant of 1819-20 took care most ingeniously of a drastic leftward
shift in axis. A relatively monumental façade, that of the County Fire Office, faced
the head of Lower Regent Street; the other façades of the Circus were regular and plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>in an almost Soanic way (Plate <a href='#pl030'>30</a>). The Quadrant gained great distinction from its
projecting colonnades of Doric columns (made of cast iron) and from the skilful placing
of a domed pavilion opposite its western end.</p>

<p class='c010'>From there on the street, as carried forward in 1820-4, proceeded more directly, but
with great variety in the individual façades—one terrace of houses over shops (1820-1)
was by Soane. There were also special pavilioned structures to phrase several slight
changes in direction and to mark the openings of intersecting streets. At Regent (now
Oxford) Circus a second circle, similar to that at Piccadilly but elaborated by Nash with
a Corinthian order, marks a major cross artery. Above this the street continues quite
straight for a little way; then comes another sharp leftward shift in the axis. There Nash
placed his All Souls’ Church, which was built in 1822-4. Its curious fluted steeple still
rises through the colonnade that crowns the tower to provide a pivot by which the eye
is carried around the sharp corner. Almost at once another right-angled turn leads into
the broad pre-existing esplanade of Adam’s Portland Place. From here on all is formal
again as at Waterloo Place.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the upper end, between the top of Portland Place and the Park, was to be a large
residential circus. Of this only the two southern quadrants were built—one of them the
earliest portion of the whole scheme, initiated at the very start in 1812. As executed,
there are above this—for this part of the scheme is all extant—two regular terraces facing
each other across Park Square.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1813, as has been said, Nash succeeded Wyatt in the Surveyor-General’s office; but
it was in the role of private entrepreneur rather than as an official that he executed the
Regent Street scheme, hazarding his own rising fortune and using every device of subleasing
to carry the project through. This he accomplished in the relatively short period
of fifteen years, even though the renewal of the war held up execution for several years
immediately after the start. Of all this nothing remains below Portland Place but the
planning and All Souls’. However, in the district east of Lower Regent Street, the Royal
Opera Arcade still exists behind New Zealand House and, much larger and more conspicuous,
the conventional temple portico of the Haymarket Theatre of 1821 stands at
the end of what is now Charles II Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the base of Waterloo Place, facing the Green Park, the two ranges of Carlton
House Terrace, built in 1827, still rise above their cast-iron Doric basement colonnades.
In the lower half of this square, south of Pall Mall, with the two clubs on either side—one
by Nash, the other by Burton—and the Duke of York’s Column silhouetted against the
distant scenery of park and Government buildings between the two wings of Carlton
House Terrace, Nash’s urbanism can still be fully appreciated. The full grandeur of
Napoleon’s Paris or Alexander I’s Petersburg is lacking, but so also is their archaeology.
This obviously belongs to the nineteenth century. It establishes, for modern eyes, Nash’s
capacity as ‘planner’ quite as much as do his terraces around Regent’s Park, as these were
carried out in 1820-7 by himself and by various younger architects working under his
general supervision.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Curiously enough, the first Regent’s Park terrace, built in 1821 while construction
was still proceeding in Park Square, was at least nominally by young Decimus Burton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>(1800-81), the talented son of the builder James Burton, who was as active here in these
years as in Bloomsbury. Dignified and severe, although not Grecian in detail like the
handsomer Ionic York Terrace and its flanking Doric villa completed the next year,
Cornwall Terrace certainly lacks the specifically Nashian qualities. Happily typical of
Nash’s response to urbanistic opportunities is the way he opened York Gate in the
middle of York Terrace through to the Marylebone Road in order to incorporate
visually the new façade provided by Thomas Hardwick (1752-1829) in 1818-19 for the
Marylebone Parish Church.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sussex Place of 1822, with its curved plan and its ten domes, is much more notably
Picturesque; but the most spectacular composition of all is Cumberland Terrace, Nash’s
in general conception, but executed by James Thomson (1800-83) in 1826-7 (Plate <a href='#pl032'>32</a>). This is far more palatial, at least superficially, than the rather humdrum Buckingham
Palace that Nash was gradually erecting for the King from 1821 on.<a id="r75"></a><a href='#f75' class='c025'><sup>[75]</sup></a> When seen
through the trees of the park or in sharp perspective from the ring road, this range of
houses provides a Picturesque three-dimensional composition of a dream-like order—what
matter if the conventional Classical elements are organized and executed in a very
slapdash way?</p>

<p class='c010'>The total scope of the Regent’s Park development provided a ‘New Town’ in a
rather complete sense inspired possibly by Ledoux’s ‘Ville Idéale’. There were detached
villas in the park, mews behind the terraces, a market-place to the east, modest two-storey
houses near by in Munster Square and, finally, the two Park Villages, carried out
by his protégé Sir James Pennethorne (1801-71) after Nash’s ideas from 1827 on. These
last are extensions of the Picturesque hamlet, consisting of groups of semi-detached villas
some of Italianate, some of Tudoresque character, loosely strung along curving roads,
which provide the very prototype of the later-nineteenth-century suburb.</p>

<p class='c010'>To most of his professional contemporaries, and not least to his associates on the Board
of the Office of Works, Soane and Smirke, Nash seemed an opportunist and almost a
charlatan. He differed as markedly from the archaeologically-minded Smirke as from
Soane, even if he was as ready to borrow Greek orders from the one as incised detail
from the other. Despite the independent stylistic position of Soane and of Nash, Britain
could hardly have produced a line of archaeologist-architects from James Stuart to C. R.
Cockerell—a line at least as distinguished as the French line from Leroy to Hittorff—without
developing by this time Greek Revival doctrines quite as rigid and as self-assured as
those of France and Germany. From the end of the second decade of the century the
Grecian mode was, indeed, rather more firmly entrenched in Great Britain than anywhere
on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The historical importance of Wilkins’s Downing College at Cambridge has already
been noted. If Wilkins was never able to complete this, so that it remained but a fragment
of an ideal Grecian college, he had greater opportunities later in London, opportunities
which on the whole he muffed. His University College of 1827-8 in Gower
Street impressed contemporaries because its central temple portico ran to <i>ten</i> columns
in width. It is not otherwise distinguished, and the advancing wings of the quadrangle
are not by him. His St George’s Hospital at Hyde Park Corner, of the same date,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>is a much more modest building (Plate <a href='#pl031'>31</a>). Yet it already shows some of the restlessness,
if little of the elaboration, of later Grecian work on the Continent, such as
Klenze’s Hermitage Museum in Petersburg. The hospital, although the theme of the
Choragic Monument of Thrasyllus is ingeniously exploited, lacks the delicacy and
elegance of Decimus Burton’s Ionic screen of 1825 across the way (Plate <a href='#pl031'>31</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The hospital is, however, rather more original than Burton’s nearby Constitution
Hill Arch, also of 1827-8, now moved back towards the Green Park. This is one of the
two erected in connexion with the new Buckingham Palace and in conscious rivalry of
those Napoleon had set up in Paris and other Continental cities. The other one, originally
forming the entrance to the court of the palace, is Nash’s Marble Arch of 1828;
that was moved to the corner of Hyde Park where Park Lane meets Oxford Street in
1851 after the palace was refronted by Blore in the late forties. Neither arch has the
urbanistic value of Benjamin Dean Wyatt’s Duke of York’s Column or of the Nelson
Column, erected in 1839 in Trafalgar Square by William Railton (1803-77), because of
their very casual siting. Apsley House, as remodelled by B. D. Wyatt for the Duke
of Wellington in 1828, rising too high beside the Burton screen, is not altogether an
addition to the group at Hyde Park Corner.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilkins’s largest and most conspicuous work, and the one which ruined his reputation,
is the National Gallery of 1832-8. The long façade of this, extending across the top
of Trafalgar Square, is excessively episodic and best seen in sharp perspective looking
along Pall Mall East or from the south side of St Martin’s-in-the-Fields. The order is not
Greek, since the columns of the portico Henry Holland (1745-1806) erected in front
of Carlton House in the early 1790s were re-used, and the little dome behind the central
pediment is almost Byzantine in character. Comparison of this Picturesque-Classical
composition with Cumberland Terrace is inevitable; the honours are all Nash’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>If Wilkins made the first Grecian spurt, it was Soane’s pupil Smirke who held the
course. In Trafalgar Square the unified range of buildings built in 1824-7 on the west
side that once housed the Union Club and later the College of Physicians contrasts
most strikingly with Wilkins’s National Gallery. Heavy, dignified, and immaculately
‘correct’ in its Greek detailing, this block also shows considerable variety in the handling
of standard Romantic Classical elements without any such striving for Picturesque effect
as the National Gallery. Later additions on the west have not seriously damaged
Smirke’s work.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is highly typical that the most considerable Grecian edifice of London should be a
museum and library. The British Museum, begun by Smirke in 1824, was not completed
until 1847.<a id="r76"></a><a href='#f76' class='c025'><sup>[76]</sup></a> Its principal internal feature, moreover, the domed Reading Room
built of cast iron in the central court (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>), was designed and carried out in
the mid fifties by Smirke’s younger brother Sydney (1798-1877). Only the King’s
Library was finished rapidly within the twenties to house the library of George III. This
is dignified and crisp, if somewhat less immaculately correct than Smirke’s façade in
Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p class='c010'>The characteristic south front of the Museum, one of the most overwhelming
examples of Romantic Classical stylophily, or love of columns—there are forty-eight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>them—was one of the last portions of the whole to be completed (Plate <a href='#pl033'>33</a>). The great
temple portico and the colonnade that is carried round the inner sides and the ends of the
flanking wings was probably not decided on until the thirties; such a redundancy of
columns seems to belong well into the second quarter of the century—compare Elmes’s
St George’s Hall in Liverpool (Plate <a href='#pl034a'>34<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) or Basevi’s Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
The façade of Smirke’s General Post Office of 1824-9, with columns used only at the
centre and the ends, and two ranges of good-sized windows between, was more characteristic
of the usual Romantic Classical balance between columnar display and rationalistic
provision for internal function.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilkins and Smirke were not alone in providing Grecian public buildings for the
London of George IV. The London Corn Exchange of 1827-8 by George Smith (1783-1869)
was an excellent example, less heavy than most of Smirke’s work, less inconsequent
than Wilkins’s. Decimus Burton, who provided various gatehouses at Hyde Park
as well as the screen at Hyde Park Corner in 1825—the modest ones at Prince’s Gate
are almost identical with Schinkel’s tiny Doric temples at the Potsdamer Tor in Berlin—also
provided the finest façade in Waterloo Place when he built the Athenaeum there in
1829-30. This clubhouse is severe and astylar externally but grand and sumptuous within
to a degree hitherto unknown. Henry Roberts (1803-76), a Smirke assistant, followed
his former master closely in the design of the Fishmongers’ Hall built in 1831-3. His
great Ionic portico rises as splendidly above the solid substructure that flanks the Thames
as Klenze’s Walhalla does above its stepped terraces.</p>

<p class='c010'>Corporate clients that came to the fore in the thirties saw in the solemn Grecian mode
the best means of achieving representational monumentality in their buildings; moreover,
they were increasingly ready to employ leading architects in order to obtain it.
C. R. Cockerell (1788-1863), the son of S. P. Cockerell, soon to be Soane’s successor as
Architect of the Bank of England, began his distinguished career as a favourite servant of
the financial world by providing the Westminster Insurance Office in the Strand in 1832
with a range of Doric half-columns. Five years later, in the London and Westminster
Bank in Lothbury, he attained a still greater effect of dignified restraint, with no loss of
sumptuousness, in an astylar façade of great originality.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new railways, whose earliest stations had been very modest indeed, were as interested
as insurance companies and banks in the representational dignity of Classical
frontispieces. At Euston Grove in London, before what was intended to be a double
station planned by the engineer Robert Stephenson (1803-59)[5<sup>a</sup>] in 1835 to serve the London
&amp; Birmingham and the Great Western Railways, there rose from the designs of Philip
Hardwick (1792-1870) the Euston ‘Arch’, a giant Greek Doric propylaeon; for the
Birmingham terminal of the railway at Curzon Street Hardwick provided a second
gateway that is more in the form of a Roman triumphal arch. This theme John Foster
(1786-1846) expanded into a continuous Roman screen in front of Lime Street Station
at Liverpool in 1836. At Huddersfield James P. Pritchett (1789-1868) and his son Charles
fronted the main station block in 1845-9 with a Roman temple portico and flanked it
with minor colonnaded features. The Monkwearmouth station by John Dobson (1787-1865)
of 1848 is similar, but Grecian in its detailing.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>More appropriate to modern eyes was the endless red-brick façade designed by
Francis Thompson for Robert Stephenson’s Trijunct Station in Derby of 1839-41.
This was astylar but had various subtle projections and recessions of the wall plane
and a comparable variety of levels in the very long skyline. Thompson also, in the
stone towers he designed for Stephenson’s Britannia Bridge of 1845-50, handled his
material with a superbly rational directness (Plate <a href='#pl061'>61</a>). The technical significance of
such structures as examples of the new uses of iron which the railways encouraged, must
be considered later (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>). Of comparable quality to Thompson’s work is the
enormous Royal Navy Victualling Yard at Stonehouse of 1826-35 by the engineer Sir
John Rennie (1794-1874)—able son, like Robert Stephenson, of a more famous engineer
father and also a brother-in-law of C. R. Cockerell. Despite the severity characteristic
of the period, this has an almost Baroque plasticity and vigour of silhouette rarely
achieved by contemporary architects before the mid-century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Except for certain large provincial and suburban Nonconformist churches, the heyday
of the temple portico came to an end about 1840. The last prominent example in
London is the Royal Exchange, built by Sir William Tite (1798-1873) in 1841-4, but
there is nothing Classical about other aspects of this prominent structure. The side, rear,
and court façades are in a sort of Neo-Baroque that prefigures the bombast of the third
quarter of the century (see Chapter <a href='#ch09'>9</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Grecian public monuments were as characteristic of provincial cities in the twenties
and thirties as of London, perhaps more so. Francis Goodwin (1784-1835)<a id="r77"></a><a href='#f77' class='c025'><sup>[77]</sup></a> provided
Manchester with a handsome town hall in 1822-4, now long since superseded. In the
latter year he lost the competition for the new Royal Institution there to the young
Charles Barry (1795-1860), hitherto most unsympathetically employed in building
cheap Gothic churches for the Commissioners.<a id="r78"></a><a href='#f78' class='c025'><sup>[78]</sup></a> This edifice Barry erected over the
years 1827-35. Happily it still stands, serving as the Manchester Art Gallery, an excellent
example of Barry’s command of that Grecian idiom which his more personal Italianate
mode forced into obsolescence even before this building was finished (see below).</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1828 Foster began the fine Grecian Custom House in Liverpool, completely destroyed,
alas, in the blitz; while in 1831 Joseph A. Hansom (1803-82) won the competition
for the Birmingham Town Hall with the most striking British example of
the temple paradigm. This characteristic Romantic Classical edifice, raised on a high
rusticated podium, was slowly executed by Hansom and his partner Edward Welch
(1806-68) over the next fifteen years and more.</p>

<p class='c010'>The more widespread the use of Greek forms became, the less vitality and character
they seemed to retain. It is not the columnar detail, so much more correct than that at
Regent’s Park, which gives interest to the terraces—built from the twenties on—that
George Basevi (1794-1845) designed for Belgrave Square in London or to those of
slightly later date designed by Lewis Cubitt (1799-?) and by John Young in Eaton
Square; it is the remarkable scale and extent of this newest urban development, rivalling
that at Regent’s Park, which was undertaken by the builder Thomas Cubitt (1788-1855),
Lewis’s brother, for the Grosvenor Estate behind the gardens of Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p class='c010'>So also at Newcastle, where Thomas Grainger (1798-1861), with the presumptive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>assistance of Dobson<a id="r79"></a><a href='#f79' class='c025'><sup>[79]</sup></a> as designer, laid out and built up a series of streets from 1834 on,
it is not the more correctly Greek orders that make Grey Street a finer piece of urbanism
than Nash’s Regent Street; it is the fine, creamy freestone that replaces London’s
stucco and the skilful organization of the ranges of buildings, all so much more carefully
grouped and related to one another than in Regent Street, along the curving and rising
slope. The Grey Column, built by John Green (?-1852) in 1837-8, is superbly placed in
the best manner of the period as a focal accent at the top of the development just like
the Duke of York’s Column at the bottom of Lower Regent Street. The cleaning of
many buildings has of late much enhanced the attractiveness of central Newcastle.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not until the early forties that Greek Revival buildings began to be characterized
by contemporaries as ‘insipid’. But Basevi’s façade of the Fitzwilliam Museum in
Cambridge, begun in 1837 and carried to completion with some emendations by C. R.
Cockerell in 1847 after Basevi’s death, well illustrates some of the changes that were
already coming over Romantic Classical design. As at Wilkins’s National Gallery, the
silhouette is elaborately varied—here much more skilfully than in Trafalgar Square. As
with Tite’s Royal Exchange, there is also a most un-Grecian sort of plastic bombast. The
orders are not Grecian but Roman, moreover, and the spirit is more Roman still, but
Roman of the later Empire in the East, as at Baalbek or Palmyra.</p>

<p class='c010'>St George’s Hall in Liverpool, the latest of the major Romantic Classical monuments
of England, was finished like the Fitzwilliam by C. R. Cockerell long after its original
designer’s death. It displays much less bombast and much more true grandeur of scale.
The young Harvey Lonsdale Elmes (1814-49) won two successive competitions, for a
Hall and for Law Courts, in 1839 and 1840 respectively. Then, when it was decided to
combine the two in one structure, he paid a visit to Berlin to study the work of Schinkel.
Schinkelesque, indeed, is the long colonnade facing Lime Street Station, and even more
so the curious square piers, free-standing in their upper half, that Elmes used elsewhere
on the building (Plate <a href='#pl034a'>34<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The temple portico at the south end is conventional enough, but with its steps boldly
raised above a massively plain foundation wall; the rounded end to the north is much
more original and also rather French in feeling. French surely, but of the Empire rather
than the contemporary July Monarchy, is the tremendous scale of the whole and the
stately axial planning of the sort to be seen in many Prix de Rome projects of the preceding
fifty years. The great hall is slightly larger than its prototype in the Baths of
Caracalla.<a id="r80"></a><a href='#f80' class='c025'><sup>[80]</sup></a> As completed by Cockerell in the early fifties, the interior lost all the Grecian
severity of the exterior. Together with the elegant elliptical concert hall, planned by
Elmes but entirely executed by Cockerell, the great hall belongs to the next period of
architectural development as much by its rich decoration as by its date.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in Scotland, not in England, that the Greek Revival had its greatest success and
lasted longest. There seems to have been some special congruity of sentiment between
Northern Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century and the ancient world.
Edinburgh, which considered itself for intellectual reasons the ‘Athens of the North’,
set out after 1810 to continue in a more Athenian mode the extension and embellishment
of her New Town begun in the 1760s. The result rivals Petersburg as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Copenhagen, Berlin, and Munich. Indeed, in Edinburgh, what was built between 1760
and 1860 provides still the most extensive example of a Romantic Classical city in the
world.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the architecture of Edinburgh is largely Classical—the most conspicuous exceptions
are the inherited medieval Castle on its rock at the head of the Old Town and the Walter
Scott Monument in Prince’s Street Gardens—the setting is extremely Picturesque.
The fullest scenic advantage was taken of the castle-crowned hill, above the filled-in and
landscaped North Loch, and of the two heights to the east and the south-east, Calton Hill
and Arthur’s Seat. The latter was kept quite clear of buildings, the former gradually
turned into a sort of Scottish Akropolis. Perhaps fortunately, the largest structure there,
the National Monument, a copy of the Parthenon by C. R. Cockerell and the local architect
W. H. Playfair (1789-1857), was never finished; thus it appears to be a ruin and
adds to the Picturesque effect of this terminus to the eastward view along Prince’s Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>Calton Hill is approached, and the view of it framed, by Waterloo Place, the buildings
of which were erected by Archibald Elliott (1763-1823) in 1815-19. This is no
unworthy rival of the homonymous square in London, despite the lack of a central
column. The view had to remain open to the hill beyond, where Playfair’s Observatory
was rising in 1814-18 and later, in 1830, the Choragic Monument by Thomas Hamilton
(1785-1858) dedicated to that very un-Grecian poet Robert Burns, as well as various
other objects of visual interest. In St Andrew’s Square in the New Town, however, is
the Melville Column. This was built by William Burn (1789-1870) in 1821-2 and based,
like the Colonne Vendôme in Paris, on that of Trajan.</p>

<p class='c010'>These Scottish architects were perhaps more fortunate than Dobson in the material
available to them; Edinburgh’s Craigleith stone becomes with time a rather deep grey,
but not so black as that in Newcastle when left uncleaned. Seen in Playfair’s terraces,
executed gradually from 1820 to 1860, which run around the base of Calton Hill on the
south, east, and north, the effect may be rather dour; but the dignity and solidity of these
Grecian ranges, rivalled in the contemporary circuses on the slopes to the north of the
eighteenth-century New Town, are undeniably impressive.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the completion of his Observatory in 1814 to the completion of the Scottish
National Gallery forty years later Playfair continued to ornament Edinburgh with
Classical (and on occasion with non-Classical) structures. Looking south along the cross-axis
of the new Town, one sees just beyond Prince’s Street his Royal Scottish Institution
begun in 1822, its rather massive Doric bulk happily crowned just after its completion
in 1836 by the seated figure of the young Queen Victoria (Plate <a href='#pl034b'>34<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Behind this lies his
Ionic National Gallery of 1850-4, which is not unworthy of comparison with Smirke’s
British Museum begun more than a quarter of a century earlier. High to the rear, on the
slopes of the Old Town, rise the two towers of the Free Church College, also by Playfair
and begun in 1846, framing with their crisp Tudorish forms the richer and more
graceful spire (sometimes attributed to Pugin) of Tolbooth St John’s, which was built
by James Gillespie Graham in 1843.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finer than any individual work of Playfair’s, and splendidly sited on the south side of
Calton Hill, is the High School by Thomas Hamilton (1784-1858). Begun in 1825, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>complex Grecian composition shows how well the lessons of the Athenian Propylaea
were learned by Scottish architects. More original, but still essentially Grecian, is
Hamilton’s Hall of Physicians in Queen Street of 1844-5.</p>

<p class='c010'>Banking was not far behind State and Church as a patron of monumental architecture
in Scotland. Before the astylar <i>palazzo</i> mode took over the financial scene, two
banks grander than any in London had been erected in the Edinburgh New Town. The
Commercial Bank of Scotland of 1846 in George Street by David Rhind (1808-83),
despite its pedimented portico, is no longer Greek in detail; the British Linen Bank of
1852 in St Andrew’s Square by David Bryce (1803-76), more plastically Roman still,
has giant detached columns upholding bold entablature blocks, an idea deriving from
C. R. Cockerell’s rejected competition design for the Royal Exchange in London.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the earlier mention of Thomson’s churches in Glasgow will have indicated, the
Greek Revival lasted even longer there than in Edinburgh. But such edifices as the
Royal Exchange of 1829-30 by David Hamilton (1768-1843) or Clarke &amp; Bell’s Municipal
and County Buildings of 1844 do not rival the work of Playfair and of the other
Hamilton in the capital; nor is there in Glasgow much good urbanism of this period.
In his domestic work Thomson remained closer to the conventional norms of the Greek
Revival than in his churches. However, in Moray Place, Strathbungo, of 1859, where
he lived himself, he produced the finest of all Grecian terraces (Plate <a href='#pl035a'>35<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) and, still later,
in Great Western Terrace an ampler if less original composition.</p>

<p class='c010'>In England the Greek Revival was barely established as the dominant mode in the
twenties before it was challenged. Barry, as has been noted earlier, began his career with
the building of cheap Commissioners’ Gothic churches, but his favourite mode was the
Renaissance Revival. We have seen that in Germany the Renaissance Revival may be
considered to begin with Klenze’s Munich work of the mid twenties. Now, in 1827-8,
Barry built the Brunswick Chapel, later St Andrew’s, at Hove in a <i>quattrocento</i> mode—the
exterior, that is, for the modest interior can hardly be thus characterized, and in its
present form includes various changes since Barry’s time. The façade looks rather nineteenth-century
French to modern eyes; yet comparable French churches, such as
Lequeux’s Saint-Jacques-Saint-Christophe in Paris, are mostly from five to fifteen years
later (see Chapter <a href='#ch03'>3</a>). Barry doubtless turned to some of the available French publications
on the Italian Renaissance for his detail, most probably to the <i>Architecture toscane</i>
of Grandjean de Montigny and Famin, but he certainly did not derive the design of his
church from current Continental practice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Following immediately upon the Brunswick Chapel, Barry built for Thomas Attree
of Brighton a symmetrical Italian Villa, now the Xavierian College, with an architectural
garden setting. This was part of a scheme, otherwise unexecuted, for surrounding
Queen’s Park, east of the town, with a range of detached houses, some Italianate,
some Tudoresque, in an extensive suburban development of the order of Nash’s only
slightly earlier Park Villages. The intended effect can best be seen in Decimus Burton’s
Calverley Estate at Tunbridge Wells carried out over the years 1828 to 1852.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far more important, however, was the fact that Barry in 1829 won with a <i>palazzo</i>
composition the competition for the new Travellers’ Club. This was built in Pall Mall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in the next two years beside the prominent corner site where Burton’s astylar but still
Grecian Athenaeum was rising. Raphaelesque on the front—although not as derivative
from Raphael’s Pandolfini Palace in Florence as was claimed at the time—but rather
Venetian on the rear, this clubhouse notably eschews the flat barrenness and the giant
orders of the Grecian mode to throw emphasis on the elegant aedicular treatment of the
windows and the bold <i>cornicione</i> which crowns the top (Plate <a href='#pl035b'>35<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Very soon Charles Fowler (1791-1867), who owned the copy of Durand’s treatise
now in the Library of the Royal Institute of British Architects, was introducing a more
utilitarian sort of Italianism in the Hungerford Market in London of 1831-3, now long
gone, and in the Lower Market at Exeter of 1835-6. There the Durandesque and almost
basilican interiors, destroyed in 1942, contrasted markedly with the Greek Doric detailing
of the façade of his Upper Market of 1837-8.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1836 Barry designed a larger edifice of the <i>palazzo</i> type, the Manchester Athenaeum
built in 1837-9. But this was overshadowed in size, in prominence, and in quality
by the new Reform Club next door to the Travellers’ in Pall Mall; for this he won the
competition in 1837, and it was built in 1838-40 (Plate <a href='#pl035b'>35<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Here his model was obviously
San Gallo’s Farnese Palace in Rome. But there are many differences such as the
unaccented entrance, the balustrade which sets the façades back from the pavement, the
simpler and more San Gallesque top storey, the corner emphasis provided by prominent
chimneys, not to speak of the metal-and-glass roofing of the central court.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barry’s two Pall Mall clubs provided architectural paradigms much followed through
the forties and well into the third quarter of the century. Moreover, W. H. Leeds (1786-1866),
in the text of a monograph on the <i>Travellers’ Club-House</i> published in 1839,
developed at some length the arguments for a Renaissance Revival. A little less evidently
than the Continental work of these years in Renaissance modes, but none the less truly,
Barry’s <i>palazzi</i> represent a continuation of Romantic Classicism. In the block-like
unity of the external masses, the regularity of the fenestration, and the extreme orderliness
of the planning his <i>palazzo</i> mode is at least as characteristic an aspect of later Romantic
Classicism in Great Britain as is the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is considerably less true of two other directions in which Barry first turned in the
thirties. It would be premature, however, to discuss here the design with which Barry
won the competition for the new Houses of Parliament in 1836 (Plate <a href='#pl054'>54</a>). As the first
major public monument to be designed anywhere in Gothic this constituted above all an
epoch-making step in the English revolt <i>against</i> Romantic Classicism (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>This is not so much the case with Barry’s first and only important essay in the ‘Jacobethan’
mode—or the Anglo-Italian as he preferred to call it—the remodelling of
Highclere Castle in Hampshire, proposed as early as 1837 and carried out over the next
two decades (Plate <a href='#pl037a'>37<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Despite the Picturesque effect of its towered and bristling silhouette,
this great country house rigidly maintains the quadrangular plan of the Reform Club
and is almost as regular as that in composition, and even more coldly crisp in its detailing.
Much the same can be said of Mentmore House in Buckinghamshire, built by Sir
Joseph Paxton (1803-65) in 1852-4 in a very similar vein but more directly derived from
Smithson’s Elizabethan Wollaton Hall near Nottingham. In general, however, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>extremely popular Jacobethan Revival of these years, even more than the contemporary
revival of the <i>style François I</i> in France, represents a reaction not merely against the Greek
Revival, as does the <i>palazzo</i> mode, but against the basic disciplines of Romantic Classicism
and was one of the major stylistic vehicles of the later Picturesque.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, the utilization of pre-Gothic medieval forms in England in this
period, so closely similar in its result to the Romanesquoid aspect of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>,
seems to have been only partly Picturesque in intention. From the twenties on a very
considerable number of churches, mostly small, had Norman Romanesque detail, but
usually there was little or no attempt to break away from the hall-like tradition of the
Late Georgian church in their plans. However, three rather large churches that are
early medieval in inspiration but not Norman in detail deserve particular mention, for
they are among the finest, though not the most historically significant, built in Britain
in the early forties.</p>

<p class='c010'>St Mary and St Nicholas’s, Wilton, built by T. H. Wyatt (1807-80) and David Brandon
(1813-97) in 1840-6 for Sydney Herbert and his Russian mother, might almost
have risen in the Prussia or the Baden of this period. However, this Italian Romanesque
basilica, with tall, detached campanile and rich internal polychromy of Cosmati-work
brought from Italy, is rather more archaeological than Persius’s or Hübsch’s churches in
Germany. On the other hand, the so much more original Christ Church of 1840-2 in
Streatham, south of London, by J. W. Wild (1814-92) is so similar to Prussian work
that some knowledge on Wild’s part of Schinkel’s suburban-church projects of a decade
earlier might almost be assumed (Plate <a href='#pl036'>36</a>). Although the exposed yellow brickwork
and the touches of external brick polychromy are notably premonitory of the next
period, the splendid obelisk-like campanile and the crisp ranges of clerestory windows,
for all their pointed tops, are quite as much within the range of Romantic Classicism as
the German churches that this recalls. The handling of the galleries of the interior had
local precedent in Soane’s churches of the twenties as well as in Schinkel’s of the
thirties. Although the barrel vaults are presumably only of plaster, St Jude’s, Bethnal
Green, in London, built by Henry Clutton (1819-93) in 1844-6, has an impressive cruciform
interior. The exterior here is notably Germanic with two thin towers flanking the
great polygonal apse.</p>

<p class='c010'>But these three churches, for all their individual excellence, are exceptional in England.
They are related to the broad contemporary current of the Renaissance Revival
that Barry had set under way only in rejecting Grecian sanctions even more completely
than he. Barry was himself too versatile ever quite to repeat the strict <i>palazzo</i> formula of
the Reform Club, although he almost came to that in the British Embassy in Istanbul of
1845-7. For this he provided sketches as early as 1842 and later emended the plans of the
local executant architect, W. J. Smith. This structure, carrying the Renaissance Revival
to, or even beyond, one edge of the western world as Grandjean de Montigny did to
Rio de Janeiro at the other edge, is considerably larger than the Reform Club and rather
bleak, though splendidly sited and very dignified indeed. At Bridgewater House in
London of 1847-57, however, Barry enriched the <i>palazzo</i> paradigm quite considerably,
not only by the introduction of a good deal of carved work but also by breaking the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>continuity of the garden front towards the Park in order to emphasize the end bays. This
personal compositional device is even more conspicuous on the river front of his Gothic
Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was for clubhouses and business buildings that Renaissance models were most
generally used in England after 1840. For the remodelling of the Carlton Club in 1847
Sydney Smirke, who had provided the winning design in a select competition, based
himself, not on San Gallo’s Farnese Palace in sixteenth-century Rome as Barry had done
at the Reform Club next door, but on Sansovino’s Library in sixteenth-century Venice.
Before this was finished in the mid fifties, C. Octavius Parnell (?-1865) and his partner
Alfred Smith had erected across Pall Mall in 1848-51 the Army and Navy Club based
on Sansovino’s Palazzo Corner della Cà Grande. Both are now gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if these architects in London were moving in the late forties towards an altogether
richer and more plastic sort of High Renaissance design, from which almost all
traces of the cold asceticism of Romantic Classicism had departed, most provincial architects
were content to stick fairly close to the Farnese Palace model of the Reform Club
well down into the sixties. This was most notably true in the design of edifices for financial
institutions. In 1840 George Alexander (?-1884), who had made his own study of the
<i>cinquecento</i> in Italy, designed the Savings Bank in Bath as a little Reform Club; the next
year in the Brunswick Buildings in Liverpool A. &amp; G. Williams applied the formula to
a much larger block of general offices. Henceforth the mode was solidly established for
almost a generation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barry usually gave a characteristically Italian Villa bent to the many country houses
that he remodelled by introducing a tall loggia-topped tower (used to store water for
the more elaborate sanitation now demanded) placed asymmetrically at one side of the
main block. The first of these was at Trentham Park, near Stoke-on-Trent, where a
second later rose in the stable court; the finest are those at Walton House near London
of 1837 and at Shrubland in Norfolk of 1848-50. In these the inherited Georgian blocks
became subordinate parts of rich three-dimensional compositions almost like the villas
that Schinkel and Persius built at Potsdam. The rebuilding of Osborne House as a
country retreat for Queen Victoria on the Isle of Wight gave Royal sanction to the
Italian Villa mode. Unfortunately she did not employ Barry; the work was done in
1845-6 and 1847-9 by the builder Thomas Cubitt and the design was dictated, if not
actually prepared, by Prince Albert.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the continued use of Greek forms for certain purposes and in some areas, the
controls of Romantic Classicism were loosening rapidly in Great Britain in the forties.
A real change of style was at hand; but since certain stylisms, such as the conventional
use of Renaissance forms, tended to continue indefinitely, it is hard to know just
where to draw the line chronologically.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Geological Museum in Piccadilly in London, built in the late forties by Pennethorne,
Nash’s protégé and his successor at the Office of Works, was far more successful
than the ballroom wing he added in the early fifties to Buckingham Palace. Even that,
however, was a considerable improvement on the curious façade—more Neo-Baroque
than Neo-Renaissance—with which Edward Blore (1787-1879) masked the front of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Nash’s edifice in 1847. The Museum was more successful precisely because its exteriors retained
the regularity and severity characteristic of Romantic Classicism. Still later, the Free
Trade Hall built by Edward Walters (1808-72) in Manchester in 1853-6 followed the
lusher Sansovinesque Italianism of Smirke’s Carlton Club, while his many handsome
warehouses there moved ever farther away from the severity of Barry’s Athenaeum
despite their generic <i>palazzo</i> character. Yet the Corn Exchange in Leeds, erected as late
as 1860 by Cuthbert Brodrick (1825-1905), is still Romantic Classical in the cool regularity
of its diamond-rusticated walls broken only by ranges of plain arches (Plate <a href='#pl037b'>37<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>There can be little question, however, that his Town Hall in Leeds of 1855-9, despite
the reiterative grandeur of its giant colonnades and the evident derivation of its principal
interior from St George’s Hall in Liverpool, is in English terms definitely ‘High Victorian’
(Plate <a href='#pl078a'>78<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). If the Corn Exchange can hardly be considered typically Early Victorian
in character, and in any case is some ten years too late in date, it might almost
be called <i>Louis Philippe</i>, so close is it to some French work of the 40s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Run-of-the-mill English railway stations of the forties, mostly designed by engineers
and minor architects, clearly rank in their dullness with the most utilitarian French work
of that decade. They indicate to what depths of conventionality late Romantic Classicism
in England had sunk by this time. Yet Lewis Cubitt’s long-demolished Bricklayers’
Arms Station in London of 1842-4, with its entrance screen compounded of rustic
Italian elements derived from the books of Charles Parker,<a id="r81"></a><a href='#f81' class='c025'><sup>[81]</sup></a> seems to have had considerable
plastic interest. Moreover, the great plain arches at the front of his King’s
Cross Station of 1850-2 (Plate <a href='#pl066a'>66<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) remain to signalize to every traveller a masterpiece
of the period more than worthy of comparison with Duquesney’s somewhat earlier
Gare de l’Est in Paris (Plate <a href='#pl022b'>22<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole, however, for all that King’s Cross is one of the major
late monuments of the rationalistic side of Romantic Classicism, it is
better to consider railway stations in relation to their sheds of iron
and glass, technically, that is, rather than stylistically
(see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>). They illustrate especially well something which the
stylistic preoccupations of the first half of the nineteenth century
tended to mask from most contemporaries, the success with which new
functional needs were satisfied in this period by the bold use of new
materials and new types of construction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet the most characteristic monuments of Romantic Classicism in Europe after those
prime urbanistic symbols of Napoleonic or counter-Napoleonic triumph, the arches,
the columns, and the obelisks that rose in all the great cities from Petersburg to Madrid,
are the museums and libraries, starting with Soane’s Dulwich Gallery, begun in 1811,
and ending with Labrouste’s Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, opened in 1850. These are
useful, yes; moreover, they serve what were effectively new purposes, purposes closely
related to the rising ideal of providing cultural opportunities for the general public. On
the whole, however, they could be carried out—and so they usually were down to
Labrouste’s library—with established methods of construction; while their cultural
significance—and in the case of the sculpture galleries from Klenze’s Glyptothek, begun
in 1816, to Bindesbøll’s Thorwaldsen Museum, opened in 1848, their very contents—seemed
to justify, if not indeed to demand, the use of Greek or Roman forms.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>In</span> varying degree Romantic Classicism left its mark on all the major cities of Europe.
Paris without the Napoleonic monuments that Louis Philippe brought to completion is
inconceivable, while Karlsruhe, Munich, Petersburg, and Edinburgh owe most of their
architectural interest to this period.</p>
<p class='c010'>In the New World, where the independence of the principal colonies of the European
nations, British, Spanish, and Portuguese, was generally established in this period or just
before it, one might expect that Romantic Classicism would have made a still more conspicuous
contribution to the architectural scene. Yet the very youth of most of the
countries of the New World, settled though many of them had been in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and also the strong cultural links that they still maintained with
the ancient traditions of their several homelands, tended to hold them back from
entering fully into the new international movement of the day in architecture. What
national libraries, moreover, were yet needed in Venezuela or Colombia, what sculpture
galleries in the American Middle West? Columns and obelisks, if not triumphal
arches, rose—frequently very belatedly—to celebrate national heroes of the various wars
of independence; but outside the eastern United States the still very simple organization
of society and the primitive means of transport required neither the institutional edifices
of France—markets, hospitals, and prisons—nor the new railway stations of England.<a id="r82"></a><a href='#f82' class='c025'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Yet in the United States, and not alone along the eastern seaboard, the period of
Romantic Classicism left a very rich architectural deposit. The monuments of real distinction
range all the way from such a church as Latrobe’s Catholic Cathedral in Baltimore
(Plate <a href='#pl005'>5</a>), one of the very finest ecclesiastical edifices of the first half of the century
to be seen anywhere, to Haviland’s Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia of
1823-35, the first to be planned on the radial cellular system (Figure <a href='#i079'>11</a>). Studied and
published by the English penologist William Crawford as well as by Demetz and
Blouet,<a id="r83"></a><a href='#f83' class='c025'><sup>[83]</sup></a> this provided a new functional concept for penal architecture influential abroad
from the time that Gilbert projected his Nouvelle Force Prison in the late thirties. Haviland’s
prison was Castellated like Lebas’s Petite Roquette, not Grecian in detail; his New
York prison of 1836-8, however, was Egyptian in detail, to which it owed its curious
nickname, ‘The Tombs’. That both Latrobe and Haviland were English-born and
English-trained is certainly significant; the latter, who was a cousin of the painter
Haydon and a pupil of H. L. Elmes’s father James (1782-1862), had first tried his luck
in Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c010'>The characteristic and almost universal use of Grecian forms in domestic building,
however, in many parts of the country continuing down to the Civil War of 1861-5,
was the result of no foreign influence. Moreover, the Grecian details were not drawn by
most architects and builders from the great basic treatise of Stuart and Revett, available
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>in America only to a very few, but at second hand from the local Builders’ Guides<a id="r84"></a><a href='#f84' class='c025'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
prepared by Haviland in Philadelphia, Asher Benjamin (1773-1845) in Boston, Minard
Lafever (1798-1854) in New York, and various others. Such authors consciously Americanized
what they borrowed from European sources in order to adapt Classical masonry
forms to the ubiquitous wooden construction of the American countryside.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are two levels of Romantic Classicism in America. Work of the upper professional
level is found chiefly in the big eastern cities where architects operated who were
either themselves foreign-born and foreign-trained or else pupils and emulators of such.
The lower vernacular level is more conspicuous in America than in Europe because it
includes a much greater proportion of building production than in older countries,
where so many structures of earlier periods remain extant. ‘Carpenter’s Grecian’, so to
call it, represents the perhaps naïve, but culturally significant, determination of all who
built to exploit, in some degree at least, the modern style of their day.</p>

<p class='c010'>The frontiersman in the Oregon of 1850 when raising a tavern in the Willamette
Valley thus shared with the new and old royalties of Europe the satisfaction of architectural
patronage. Moreover, like so many English gentlemen of the eighteenth century
or such a nineteenth-century prince as Frederick William IV, he often took a hand
at design himself. In this he was assisted by memories of the relatively settled towns he
had left behind in the Middle West, themselves largely products of this period architecturally,
and also by the Builders’ Guides issuing from the east in recurrent editions.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not alone the transient patronage of a Corsican soldier, for a few brief years
heir to Louis XIV and overlord of Europe, nor the Building Committee of an autocrat
on the banks of the Neva controlling all public and private architecture in an Imperial
capital for a quarter of a century, that really established Romantic Classicism as the last
universal style before that of our own day. It is the fact that Boston architects and
builders, when Quincy granite (that most perfect of Romantic Classical building
materials) became readily available in the mid twenties, arrived at a rational sort of
trabeated design as distinguished as Schinkel’s; while three thousand miles to the west,
and a quarter of a century later, amateur builders working in wood produced almost
the same sort of ‘pilastrades’, simplified well beyond the Americanized paradigms of
Greek antae they found in the plates of Asher Benjamin’s books, as Schinkel had in
Berlin.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Grecian writ ran far south to Buenos Aires in Latin America, where the broad
portico of the cathedral, designed by the French engineer Prosper Catelin and built in
1822, follows closely Grand Prix designs of the 1790s; and deep into the Antipodes as
well where Australia moved like the United States into nationhood and into the Greek
Revival at much the same time, but at a slower pace and with less sophistication.</p>

<p class='c010'>Washington, as the greatest fiat city of the period, might well have been, rather than
Edinburgh, the Romantic Classical city <i>par excellence</i>. Even so, as it was laid out by a
French engineer in the 1790s the prototype of its plan was not the Baroque city but the
French hunting park. And L’Enfant envisaged for it no walled-in streets and squares but
rather the isolated block-like structures that once stood around his ‘circles’ as some still
stand around Fischer’s Karolinenplatz in Munich. In Washington, moreover, from 1803
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>when Jefferson made him Surveyor of Public Buildings until 1817, Latrobe generally
had his headquarters; there his pupil Mills became Government Architect and Engineer
in 1836, retaining the post until 1851.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The great monuments of the thirties still stand in Washington, mostly designed by
Mills himself at the peak of his career. But at the Capitol (Plate <a href='#pl082a'>82<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), rising at the head
of the main axis of the city, the Romantic Classical elements of the edifice completed in
1827 by Bulfinch are now all but invisible between and below the wings and the dome
added after 1851 by Thomas U. Walter (1804-87). Hoban’s White House, moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>on the cross axis, remains, despite its restoration by Latrobe after the War of 1812
and two twentieth-century campaigns of enlargement and reconstruction, a quite
Anglo-Palladian—indeed, almost Gibbsian—work. These focal edifices largely belie
the Romantic Classical ideals so boldly epitomized in the tallest of all nineteenth-century
obelisks, Mills’s Washington Monument. This was designed in 1833, begun in
1848, and not completed until 1884, when T. L. Casey, an Army engineer, sharpened
the pitch of the pyramidon and crowned it with solid aluminium.</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately beside the White House, however, the Grecian granite of Mills’s
Treasury (Plate <a href='#pl038a'>38<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), worthy of Playfair if not of Schinkel, is overshadowed by the
former State, War and Navy Department Building with its tremendous Second
Empire plasticity (Plate <a href='#pl082b'>82<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Begun in 1836, when Mills received his official appointment,
the Treasury was largely completed by 1842; the west wing was added by Isaiah
Rogers (1800-69) in 1862-5 following the original design.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mills’s career got under way decades before he was called to Washington (see Chapter
1). Churches in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Baltimore occupied him first, of which
the most notable is the octagonal Monumental Church in Richmond begun in 1812.
This is an austere structure with a strongly geometrical organization of the elements,
but much less suave and refined than Latrobe’s Baltimore Cathedral. Polygonal planning
also gives original character to his Insane Asylum of 1821-5 in Columbia, S.C.;
but this has, at the front, a giant Greek Doric portico such as was just becoming even
more conventional in America than in Europe at this time.</p>

<p class='c010'>In an age so monumentally-minded it was a much earlier work, for which Mills won
the competition in 1814, the monument erected in honour of Washington at Baltimore
in 1815-29, that first made his national reputation. This was the first giant column to be
erected in the New World. Superbly placed on a square podium of almost Egyptian
severity at the centre of cruciform Mt Vernon Place, this Doric shaft is one of the most
effective of the many that this period produced, even if it lacks the megalomaniac scale
of his later obelisk in Washington. Mills claimed credit also for proposing the obelisk
form for the Bunker Hill Monument<a id="r85"></a><a href='#f85' class='c025'><sup>[85]</sup></a> which Solomon Willard (1783-1861) erected in
Charlestown, Mass., in 1825-43.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Washington Mills’s Government buildings include, besides the Treasury and the
Monument, the Patent Office and the old Post Office Department, both begun in 1839.
These are sober masonry edifices of wholly fireproof construction incorporating much
vaulting. They are dominated by Grecian porticoes, like the Treasury, but without
that more conspicuously sited structure’s peristyles along the sides. Mills’s smaller custom
houses in various seaboard towns are simple and massive blocks of granite ashlar,
the best preserved today being that in New London, Conn. These provided worthy
symbols of Federal authority among the slighter edifices of wood and brick that filled
the seaports of this period. Like Latrobe, Mills was as much engineer as architect, which
helps to explain his preoccupation with fireproof construction; moreover, lighthouses
and waterworks figured prominently in his total production.<a id="r86"></a><a href='#f86' class='c025'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Mills, more than anyone else, set the high standard of design and construction for
Federal buildings that was fortunately maintained by his successors until after the Civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>War. These were Ammi B. Young (1800-74), who took over the Government post<a id="r87"></a><a href='#f87' class='c025'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
in 1852, and Rogers, who followed him ten years later in 1862. In remote San Francisco
the Grecian rule in Federal architecture continued very late, as the U.S. Mint there
of 1869-74 rather surprisingly indicates. This was possibly designed by Rogers just
before his death even though A. B. Mullet had succeeded him in office in 1865.</p>

<p class='c010'>Related to the Romantic Classicism of Washington is certain Virginia work. Arlington
House, as remodelled by the English-born and English-trained Hadfield, rises just
across the Potomac River on a high hill-crest; by its tremendously overscaled Paestum-like
temple portico, added in 1826 to give grandeur to a modest earlier mansion, this
provides a more monumental note in the Washington scene than anything of this period
inside the city except Mills’s obelisk and his Treasury.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just outside Charlottesville, Jefferson, after his retirement from the Presidency, devoted
himself architecturally as well as educationally from 1817 until his death to the
organization of the University of Virginia and the construction of its buildings. The
layout, with pavilions for the various professors’ use linked by porticoed galleries behind
which the students’ rooms are placed, culminated at the upper end in the Library
and was originally open<a id="r88"></a><a href='#f88' class='c025'><sup>[88]</sup></a> to the view at the bottom (Figure <a href='#i083'>12</a>). Although most of the
pavilions reflect earlier stages of Romantic Classicism—if not usually the Anglo-Palladian
with which Jefferson’s architectural career had begun half a century earlier—this
is a more remarkable entity than his Virginia Capitol. Perhaps it has a lesser general
historical importance, yet it is certainly not without special significance for America.
This is most notably true of one of the pavilions whose design was suggested to Jefferson
by Latrobe in 1819. Here for the first time a modern American dwelling, and one of
quite modest size—for these pavilions were used as houses for the professors as well as
providing classrooms on the ground storey—was encased within the shell of a prostyle
Greek temple. Moreover, Jefferson accomplished this rather more successfully than
Beaumont in France in the late eighteenth century at the Temple de Silence, or Wilkins
in England at Grange Park in 1809.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not the least successful among the innumerable imitations of the Roman Pantheon,
the building which originally served as the Library of the University, built in 1822-6,
dominated the two ranges of colonnade-linked pavilions (Plate <a href='#pl038b'>38<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Here more
drastically than by Wilkins at Downing College or Ramée at Union, the earlier Anglo-Saxon
patterns of educational architecture were reconstituted in Romantic Classical
guise, yet the University of Virginia did not have a very considerable influence,
then or later. The central group at Amherst College in Massachusetts—two dormitories
of 1821 and 1822 and a chapel between of 1827—offers a modest group of quite
different but equally notable quality on a splendid hill-crest site (Plate <a href='#pl045'>45</a>). At other
colleges only individual structures usually survive from this period.</p>

<p class='c010'>The temple house, initiated by Jefferson and Latrobe, had a tremendous success with
builders in the thirties and forties, particularly in the new territories west of the Alleghenies.
But the finest and most paradigmatic came rather earlier and were architect-designed.
Ithiel Town (1784-1844), for example, built the Bowers House in Northampton,
Mass., in 1825-6 with an Ionic portico on the main block and fronted the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>side wings with antae. The big Corinthian Russell house, a pure temple with no side
wings—the present wing was added later—rose in Middletown, Conn., to the design of
his partner, A. J. Davis (1803-92), in 1828.</p>

<p class='c010'>From such a ‘Parthenon’ as Berry Hill in Virginia, built by its owner James Coles
Bruce in 1835-40, which is flanked by two lodges also of temple form, to innumerable
more modest houses in the older towns of Ohio and Michigan, the roster of such edifices
is infinitely extensive. It is also surprisingly varied in scale and in the materials used—most,
but not all, are of white-painted wood—as also in the handling of the dominating
columnar porticoes. In the South, for example, the characteristic plantation houses of
Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi are peripteral but unpedimented, with
external galleries splitting the height of the giant columns. Natchez in Mississippi has
several fine examples; in Louisiana, Greenwood near St Francisville of about 1830 may
be specifically mentioned, and also Oak Alley of 1836 at Vacherie near New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most ambitious Grecian houses of the Deep South are often very late in date, and
architects were rarely employed to design them. Moreover, Greek detail was adopted in
the South only very slowly and rarely used with the correctness of the Northern builders,
who leaned so heavily on the plates of the orders in the books of Benjamin and others.
Belle Meade, near Nashville, of 1853, being by the distinguished Philadelphia architect
Strickland, is something of an exception in several ways; it had, for example, a fine
portico of square antae executed in white marble that was almost Schinkelesque. Vast
Belle Grove at White Castle, Louisiana, built by Henry Howard in 1857, was probably
more effective in the romantically ruinous state in which it existed for many years before
its final destruction than in its pristine condition, so confusedly eclectic was the general
composition, with Italianate as well as Classical elements quite casually mixed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unpedimented porticoes are not unknown in the North, both east and west of the
Alleghenies, as in the Levi Lincoln house of 1836 (once in Worcester, Mass., now moved
to nearby Sturbridge) by Elias Carter (1781-1864) with its convex-fluted Doric order.
Such original touches, which many carpenters introduced out of plain ignorance and
more sophisticated architects developed out of a conscious desire to nationalize and personalize
even such absolute paradigms as those of the Greek orders, often lend variety
and piquancy to the mode. The finest Grecian houses, such as Elmhyrst at One Mile
Corner, Newport, R.I., built probably by Russell Warren (1783-1860) about 1833,
certainly owe their originality to the studied intentions of architects. This house, in
particular, has a façade composed in overlapping planes that is not unworthy of Cockerell
(Plate <a href='#pl042b'>42<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). On the other hand, the Hermitage near Savannah, Georgia, designed by
Charles B. Cluskey <i>c.</i> 1830, could almost be by Schinkel, so simple and pure is its design.</p>

<p class='c010'>Trained architects, on the whole, were too rationalistic or too adventurous to
follow closely the plain temple model in domestic or institutional work. Walter presumably
surrounded Andalusia, the home of the philhellene banker Nicholas Biddle
outside Philadelphia, with a Doric temple-shell in 1833 only against his own better
judgement. In 1833-47 he also built for Girard College in Philadelphia, of which Biddle
was the trustee who called the tune, an enormous Corinthian temple. Inside this he incorporated
a variety of educational functions only with considerable difficulty, but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>vaulted all the interiors in the manner of Latrobe and Mills in order to provide a completely
fireproof structure.<a id="r89"></a><a href='#f89' class='c025'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Curiously enough, this was one of the first American buildings
to be published abroad,<a id="r90"></a><a href='#f90' class='c025'><sup>[90]</sup></a> thus rivalling Haviland’s prison, but it attracted no
emulators in Europe. By the thirties, of course, these buildings by Walter were no
novelties in Philadelphia.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Philadelphia, the former colonial metropolis and briefly the national capital, was
much more than Washington the cultural centre of the country in the early decades of
the century. Here Latrobe had had his start, significantly with a bank in the form of an
Ionic temple. Now in 1818 Strickland,<a id="r91"></a><a href='#f91' class='c025'><sup>[91]</sup></a> a native-born American and quite untravelled,
won in competition the commission for building the Branch Bank of the United States
with a much more archaeologically correct temple. Like various European and British
public monuments of the period, but unlike any bank abroad, this is a marble Parthenon.
But the various needs of the banking business were skilfully provided for inside, and the
principal barrel-vaulted interior is very fine indeed. Built in 1819-24, this bank (later a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Custom House) rivals the Bavarian Walhalla and the Scottish National Monument,
though lacking their splendid hill-top sites. It was just the thing to establish Strickland’s
national reputation. But his Merchants’ Exchange in Philadelphia of 1832-4, with a
rounded end and a trabeated ground storey, provides more interesting and impressive
evidence of his talent, perhaps the greatest of the generation following Latrobe in
America (Plate <a href='#pl040'>40</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Strickland’s latest major work, the State Capitol in Nashville, Tennessee, of 1845-9,
still a temple but with various accretions, has the high site his bank lacked, but it suffers
otherwise from the general deterioration of the sense of Grecian style after the mid
thirties, a deterioration quite as evident in American architecture as in European. This
Tennessee temple was the last but one of a series of state capitols that followed the
model of Jefferson’s at Richmond, Virginia, rather than Bulfinch’s dome-crowned
Boston State House or the national Capitol in Washington. The first example that was
correctly Greek in detail seems to have been that for Connecticut in New Haven; it was
built by Town and his partner Davis in 1827-31, and has long since been demolished.
However, that designed by Gideon Shryock (1802-80) in Frankfort, Kentucky, was
going up at about the same time.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1831-5 Davis built a larger and grander Greek Doric temple (no longer extant) as
a Capitol for Indiana at Indianapolis, but provided it with a small central dome. The
latest of all the temples built to serve as state capitols was a very modest one of 1849 at
Benicia, California, where the columnar portico was reduced to two Doric columns <i>in
antis</i>—it is worth noting that this was erected in the very year that Sutter’s gold strike
first put California on the map of the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other state capitols of this period are Grecian but not of temple form; a good example
is that Town &amp; Davis built at Raleigh, North Carolina, which was begun in 1833. The
finest of all is that for Ohio at Columbus,<a id="r92"></a><a href='#f92' class='c025'><sup>[92]</sup></a> begun in 1839-40 and carried to completion
over the years 1848-61. Here the giant ‘pilastrade’, for which columns are substituted in
the central third of the front, has a Schinkel-like directness and severity (Plate <a href='#pl039a'>39<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Not
so happy is the flat-topped central lantern, which is also surrounded by a pilastrade. In
conscientious pursuit of trabeated consistency the architects thus sought to mask the
rounded shape of the dome within, as had been tried in various French projects of the
late eighteenth century and by Schinkel in the Altes Museum already.</p>

<p class='c010'>After Philadelphia, Boston was the architectural metropolis of this period; and from
Boston, beginning in 1827, issued the later treatises of Benjamin purveying the Grecian
orders to carpenters and builders all over the North and the Middle West. Here Bulfinch,
however, established as the leading architect in the 1790s, long remained faithful
to the ideals of Chambers and Adam (see Chapter <a href='#ch01'>1</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>At University Hall, built for Harvard College in Cambridge, Mass., in 1813-15, Bulfinch
used granite for the ashlar of the walls as he had done for his Boston City Hall of
1810, but the white-painted wooden trim is not yet Grecian. The Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston, also of granite, was designed by him in 1816-17, just before he left
for Washington to take over from Latrobe supervision of the construction of the Capitol.
The hospital building (now known as the Bulfinch Pavilion) as executed by Alexander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Parris (1780-1852) in 1818-20 is certainly a mature Romantic Classical edifice if not
a typically Grecian one. Above the plain pediment of the central portico a square attic
with corner chimneys supports the saucer dome, and the long side wings with three
ranges of unframed windows display the fine granite ashlar of Boston in all its cold
pride. Compared to Latrobe, however, Bulfinch remained a provincial if not a colonial
designer, high as is the intrinsic quality of his best work.</p>

<p class='c010'>A younger generation, hitherto much influenced by Bulfinch’s established manner,
took over leadership in Boston on his departure for Washington. Parris soon provided
the first Greek temple in conservative New England when he built St Paul’s Church
(now the Anglican Cathedral) in Tremont Street in 1819-21. Where Strickland’s contemporary
Philadelphia bank was Doric and of marble, this is Ionic with the portico
executed in the Acquia Creek sandstone from Virginia which was then being used so
much in Washington. Solomon Willard carved the capitals. Parris’s Stone Temple of
1828, the Unitarian ‘Church of the Presidents’—the two Adams presidents—in Quincy,
Mass., is not at all a temple in form but more comparable to the Grecian churches built
in England in this decade. The Stone Temple outranks most of them in dignity, however,
because of the superbly appropriate local material of which it is built. It was from
this town that the Quincy granite came that was employed for the best Boston buildings
of the next thirty years and more, and this church was a relatively early instance of its
monumental use. Quincy granite had become more readily available after the first
American railway was built from the quarries to the seashore by Willard solely to
facilitate bringing it out by water.<a id="r93"></a><a href='#f93' class='c025'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The first notable use of this granite away from Quincy had been for the Bunker Hill
Monument in Charlestown, Mass., built by Willard in 1825-43. Not only Mills, as has
been mentioned, but the sculptor Horatio Greenough<a id="r94"></a><a href='#f94' class='c025'><sup>[94]</sup></a> and also Parris claimed, and
perhaps deserve, some credit for the particular form of this simple but grandiose obelisk,
which rivalled those of the Old World a decade before Mills’s in Washington was
designed. On its completion, a steam-operated lift or elevator was provided in 1844
capable of carrying six people; this was one of the earliest examples of an important
technical device that would later influence architecture profoundly (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Granite imposed rigid restrictions on detailing. But the new generation knew how to
make of those restrictions an opportunity for developing a highly original sort of basic
classicism such as even the most determined European rationalists rarely approached. The
houses at 39-40 Beacon Street in Boston, now occupied by the Women’s City Club, and
the David Sears house at No. 42, now the Somerset Club (Plate <a href='#pl043b'>43<span class='fss'>B</span></a>)—the latter by
Parris and of 1816, the former probably by him and of 1818—as also the granite terrace
at Nos. 70-75, probably by Benjamin, are good examples of domestic work of this
period. More important is Parris’s Quincy (properly Faneuil Hall) Market in Boston,
designed in 1823 for Mayor Joseph Quincy as the central feature of a considerable urbanistic
development on the site of earlier docks. This domed and porticoed structure lacks
the geometrical severity of the Sears house with its great bow on the front and its
superbly placed scroll panel; but in the Market House Parris not only used cast iron
for the internal supports but also experimented on the exterior with a trabeated framework
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of monolithic granite piers and lintels. The same sort of ‘granite skeleton’ construction
(so to call it) was also used but with greater delicacy of proportion and elegance
of finish—note the Soanic incised detail of the wooden window-frames—for the commercial
buildings<a id="r95"></a><a href='#f95' class='c025'><sup>[95]</sup></a> which Parris designed and that various lessees shortly built along the
streets that flank the Market House to the north and the south (Plate <a href='#pl112b'>112<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This was one
of the major structural innovations of the period (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Within a few years other Boston architects and builders were currently using
this sort of construction, and it soon spread to several New England cities. However,
more typical of the urban ambition of the twenties and thirties than the destroyed
block of 1824 in Providence by J. H. Green (1777-1850), which followed line for line
Parris’s commercial work, are two other buildings there. The Providence Arcade of
1828 by Warren has not one, but two terminal porticoes of Ionic columns executed in
granite and also a fine interior consisting of raised side galleries under an iron-and-glass
roof. Few extant galleries of this decade in Europe are as notable in scale and in finish.
The Washington Buildings of 1843 by James C. Bucklin (1801-90), who had assisted
Warren on the Arcade, had a plain range of three storeys of window-pierced red-brick
wall above a trabeated granite ground storey, the whole dominated by a central pedimented
feature (Plate <a href='#pl039b'>39<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This was a commercial project as grand as any in contemporary
Europe in scale, in materials, and in finish, although without the originality
of the trabeated all-granite bow-front of Rogers’s contemporary Brazier’s Buildings on
State Street in Boston. Yet Bucklin’s Westminster Presbyterian Church in Providence
of 1846 is a straight Greek Ionic temple like so many other non-Anglican edifices of this
period in England and America.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where Romantic Classicism, and more specifically the Greek Revival, found its
noblest opportunities in Europe in public monuments, in America after the days of
Latrobe it was rather commercial, institutional, and even industrial<a id="r96"></a><a href='#f96' class='c025'><sup>[96]</sup></a> commissions that
stimulated architects and builders to original achievement, while public work grew
more and more conventional. For instance, the Lippitt Woollen Mill of 1836 in Woonsocket,
R.I., and the Governor Harris Manufactory at Harris, R.I., dating from as late as
1851 can both be properly described as ‘in the Grecian vernacular’. They are most
admirably proportioned and very soundly built, with walls of random ashlar masonry and
boldly scaled wooden trim, very plain, yet of generically Greek character. The discipline
of Romantic Classicism accorded well with the requirements of industrial building; not
until the present century would factories of comparable architectural quality be built.
Moreover, they were often complemented by consonant low-cost housing, as in the
extant mill village at White Rock, R.I., of 1849.</p>

<p class='c010'>No European public edifice has a grander Greek Doric portico than that which
dominates the tremendous four-storey front block of the Lunatic Asylum in Utica,
N.Y., of 1837-43, designed by no architect, according to the records, but by the Chairman
of the Board of Trustees, William Clarke (Plate <a href='#pl046'>46</a>). Still later, in 1850, after the
Grecian mode was <i>passé</i> with most architects if not with the general public, Davis built
in the Renaissance Revival mode that he called ‘Tuscan’ the Insane Asylum at Raleigh,
North Carolina; this is distinguished by his characteristic arrangement of the windows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>in tall vertical bands. Such American institutions are not at all unworthy of comparison
with the best French productions of the period by Gilbert and others, although generally
of rather smaller size (Plate <a href='#pl020'>20</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Hotels in Europe had not as yet received much architectural elaboration, nor did they
in general before the mid century. Such English hotels of Grecian pretension as the
Queen’s by W. C. and R. Jearrad at Cheltenham, which opened in 1837, or the Great
Western in Bristol by R. S. Pope (1781-?), opened two years later, are rather exceptional,
being located at spas, and in any case a decade later in date than the first notable
American example. It was in Boston, at the Tremont House built in 1828-9, a Grecian
granite structure of dignified grandeur externally (Plate <a href='#pl041'>41</a>) and of considerable functional
elaboration internally (Figure <a href='#i087'>13</a>), that Rogers and his clients consciously initiated
a new standard of hotel design. For thirty years Rogers himself, in various hotels from
New Orleans—the St Charles—to Cincinnati—the Burnet House—all long ago demolished,
personally maintained and, at least in terms of functional organization, continued
to raise that standard. Not for nothing did the big new London hotels of a generation
later label their bars and their barber-shops ‘American’.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>In 1832 Rogers began the Astor House in New York; when completed in 1836 this
already outranked the Tremont House in every way. Not least extraordinary must have
been the elaborately fan-vaulted hall. This reflected that eclectic interest in Gothic of
which Rogers’s wooden Unitarian Church of 1833 in Cambridge, Mass., provides
extant evidence. The last hotel that he built was the Maxwell House in Nashville,
Tennessee, of 1854-60.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rogers’s pre-eminence at hotel design was signalized from the first by the publication
in 1830 of a monograph on the Tremont House;<a id="r97"></a><a href='#f97' class='c025'><sup>[97]</sup></a> thus the hotel joined the prison as a
type of building in which American influence became important internationally. But
Rogers’s practice was by no means confined to hotels; among other things he gave
both Boston and New York their Merchants Exchanges long before he became Supervising
Architect in Washington. The colonnade of the latter, a little like that of Schinkel’s
Altes Museum, still survives at the base of McKim, Mead &amp; White’s First National
City Bank in Wall Street to illustrate Rogers’s high competence at handling a standard
Romantic Classical theme.</p>

<p class='c010'>Resort hotels repeated the same Grecian themes in wood, their columns being often
much attenuated in order to rise three and four storeys above the circumambient
verandas. However, an early example, the first Ocean House of 1841 at Newport, R.I.,
had a colonnade only two storeys tall set against the main four-storey block. On the
Atlantic House there of 1844 the fourth storey occupied the broad Greek entablature
surrounding the entire main block, but the front portico of elongated Ionic columns was
only hexastyle. Both were burnt many years ago, but later examples of inferior quality
remain in several forgotten spas and mountain resorts of the period, particularly in New
York State.</p>

<p class='c010'>New York City was drawing architectural talent in these years from other cities. Before
Rogers moved there from Boston in 1834, mid way in the Astor House campaign,
Town &amp; Davis had arrived from Connecticut. Davis’s Sub-Treasury in Wall Street
begun in 1834,<a id="r98"></a><a href='#f98' class='c025'><sup>[98]</sup></a> however, is rather less successful than the earlier New England houses of
similar temple form that he and Town had designed. Davis was himself more notably a
protagonist of the Picturesque, despite all the very large and prominent Grecian buildings
for which he was responsible (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>). Yet his Colonnade Row in Lafayette
Street of 1832, a terrace all of freestone with a free-standing giant Corinthian colonnade,
equals in grandeur anything of the period that London or Edinburgh have to offer
(Plate <a href='#pl042a'>42<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). More typical of New York in this period than Colonnade Row, and of uncertain
authorship, is the terrace of red-brick Grecian houses built on the north side of
Washington Square in the thirties, of which a few have survived on sufferance the vandalous
encroachments of New York University.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some of the finest Greek houses are by provincial architects. One such is stone-built
Hyde Hall in Cooperstown, N.Y., very crisp and severe as it was remodelled in 1833
by Philip Hooker (1766-1836) of Albany, who had built it originally in 1811. Still
others are of uncertain authorship, notably the Alsop house of 1838 in Middletown,
Conn. This is a symmetrical Grecian villa almost worthy of Schinkel’s Potsdam, with
very fine murals on the exterior as well as inside. The Alsop house (now the Davison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Art Centre of Wesleyan University) was probably designed by a relative of the family
who had access to the resources of the Town &amp; Davis office; however, the painters employed
were Italian or German. The Wooster-Boalt house of 1848 in Norwalk, Ohio,
indicates the late continuance of real restraint and sophistication of design in the Middle
West, something already lost in the sumptuous mansions of New Orleans and the Deep
South. But many Middle Western houses illustrate rather the surprising elasticity of
Carpenters’ Grecian.</p>

<p class='c010'>A mode that approaches the German <i>Rundbogenstil</i>—indeed, in the work of such
foreign-trained architects as the Prague-born Leopold Eidlitz (1823-1908) relatively
authentic examples of that mode—was not uncommon in the America of the mid century.<a id="r99"></a><a href='#f99' class='c025'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
The Astor Library in Lafayette Street opposite Colonnade Row, built by A.
Saelzer in 1849, was a good example. Less successful was Appleton Chapel at Harvard
College in Cambridge, Mass., by Paul Schulze (1827-97), who sent over the drawings
from Germany, and later settled in America. Begun in 1856, this was a very reduced
version of Gärtner’s Ludwigskirche in Munich with only one tower. However, the
largest and finest example was by a precocious student at Brown University, Thomas A.
Tefft (1826-59).<a id="r100"></a><a href='#f100' class='c025'><sup>[100]</sup></a> This was the Union Station in Providence, begun in 1848 and gradually
carried out by Bucklin and his partner Talman (Plate <a href='#pl044'>44</a>). This station rivalled in
extent and in the distinction and ingenuity of its rather Lombardic Romanesque detailing,
simply executed with ordinary red brick, the German ones by Eisenlohr and Bürklein
in Baden and Bavaria; without much question it was the finest early station in the
New World. Tefft also designed various New England churches of somewhat similar
character, all dominated by very tall and simple spires. However, his churches in the
East are outrivalled by such a Middle Western example as the Union Methodist in St
Louis, built by George I. Barnett (1815-98) in 1852-4. Tefft’s best works, other than
the station, are not <i>Rundbogenstil</i> but Barryesque; such is the brownstone Tully-Bowen
house on Benefit Street in Providence of 1852-3, for example. Others were building as
fine ones there, however. The consistent use of brownstone and red brick well illustrates
the sharp reaction that had set in by his time against the pale tones and untextured surfaces
of the Greek Revival.</p>

<p class='c010'>The towered Italian Villa<a id="r101"></a><a href='#f101' class='c025'><sup>[101]</sup></a> was introduced by John Notman (1810-65) in Bishop
George W. Doane’s house at Burlington, NJ., in 1837 and soon actively propagandized
by A. J. Downing (1815-52) in his influential books (see Chapters <a href='#ch06'>6</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). Indeed,
the Barryesque Renaissance mode was also probably first introduced by the
Scottish-born Notman at the Philadelphia Atheneum<a id="r102"></a><a href='#f102' class='c025'><sup>[102]</sup></a> built in 1845-7 (Plate <a href='#pl047a'>47<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
These non-Grecian, yet still basically Romantic Classical, modes were in relatively common
use by 1850, though not very much earlier. Young, for example, who had made his
reputation with the saucer-domed but otherwise Greek Custom House<a id="r103"></a><a href='#f103' class='c025'><sup>[103]</sup></a> that he built in
Boston in 1837-47, substituted a somewhat Barryesque manner for Mills’s Grecian as the
current mode for Federal buildings<a id="r104"></a><a href='#f104' class='c025'><sup>[104]</sup></a> when he became Supervising Architect in 1853.
But neither Notman nor Young was a Barry—nor even as competent at such design as
the youthful Tefft—and the most notable result of the waning of the Greek Revival
in the forties, in the East at any rate—it waned much more slowly in the South and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>West—was the rise of a rather considerable variety of Picturesque modes of suburban-house
design, of which the Italianate was only one (see Chapters <a href='#ch06'>6</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). In cities,
the shift from the characteristic granite or, more usually, hard red brick with white
trim to the chocolate tones of brownstone, used alone or with brick, is much more
indicative of a general change of taste than any widespread exploitation of Renaissance
forms.</p>

<p class='c010'>A fine relatively early Italian Villa such as the Stebbins house of 1849 on Crescent St,
off Maple St, in Springfield, Mass., by Henry A. Sykes belongs to the realm of Romantic
Classicism like Schinkel’s or Barry’s country houses in this mode (Plate <a href='#pl043a'>43<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But on
the whole the Italian Villa in America is rather one of the many vehicles of the Picturesque
reaction against a doctrinaire Greek Revival. This fact was well illustrated in
one by Eidlitz, also in Springfield, on Maple Street, that was built of brick with much
wooden ‘gingerbread’ of a vaguely Tyrolean order and latterly, at least, painted a warm
pink where Sykes’s villa is painted white with brown trim. Sykes’s originality within
the Italian Villa mode is most happily illustrated by the former observatory at Amherst
College, now known as the Octagon, whose stuccoed polygonal elements stand in such
interesting contrast to the severe row of red-brick dormitories and chapel behind. Not
often did the mid century add so effectively to groups of buildings produced in earlier
decades.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as the Iberian peninsula was in general devoid of significant architectural activity
in the first half of the nineteenth century, so in the Spanish and Portuguese lands beyond
the seas there came no early wave of autochthonous Romantic Classicism to submerge
and succeed the Baroque that had flourished there to the end of the colonial period and
beyond. In Brazil Dom Pedro, later the first Brazilian Emperor, under whose rule the
centre of gravity of Portuguese civilization moved from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, imported
in 1816 a group of French artists. They were expected to found a new post-Baroque
Brazilian culture much as Alexander I’s architects had done a little earlier in
Russia. One was the French architect Grandjean de Montigny, author with Famin of
that most influential work <i>L’Architecture toscane</i> to which all Europe turned for <i>quattrocento</i>
models, who had been employed by Jerome Bonaparte in Westphalia as long as
Napoleon’s Empire lasted. He erected in Rio in 1826 the first home for the new Imperial
Academy of Fine Arts, founded of course on the model of the Parisian École des Beaux-Arts,
the Market, and the extant Custom House. He also trained a group of Brazilians
who gave local architectural production an Empire flavour that lasted until it was superseded
well after the mid century by a wave of Second Empire influence.</p>

<p class='c010'>In vernacular building traditional treatments were often maintained in Brazil, notably
the use of <i>azulejos</i> (glazed tiles) for wall surfaces and of rich painted colour for the
ubiquitous stucco. But more sophisticated work can be very French indeed. For example,
the Itamaratí Palace in Rio of 1851-4 by J. M. J. Rebelo, a pupil of Grandjean de Montigny,
might well be taken for a <i>hôtel particulier</i> erected in the new quarters of Paris in the
earlier decades of the century (Plate <a href='#pl047b'>47<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Beautifully restored, this now houses the
Brazilian Foreign Office—one says ‘Itamaratí’ as one says ‘Quai d’Orsay’. Rebelo also
built the Summer Palace at Petrópolis. The Santa Isabel Theatre at Recife, Pernambuco,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>built about 1845, which is so like a French provincial theatre of this period, is by another
French architect who had settled in Brazil in 1840, L.-L. Vauthier.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Chile, on the other side of the South American continent, C.-F. Brunet-Debaines
(1799-1855), a brother of the architect who built the Museum and Library at Le Havre,
was employed on government work in Santiago. But the schools that such French architects
assisted in founding had more significance than the few buildings they were able to
erect. Henceforth, Latin America would be less dependent in architecture on the
Spanish and Portuguese homelands than on Paris. The character of the larger cities outside
their colonial cores—if, indeed, more than a few early monuments remain extant—was
henceforth determined by this fact. However, it is the Second Empire and not the
First which left the more visible mark; for the various capitals, some like Montevideo in
Uruguay almost without earlier architectural history, saw their greatest expansion in the
later decades of the nineteenth century and the first of the twentieth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The establishment of a Latin American architecture of really
autochthonous character, as distinguished from the continuance of
various local vernacular building traditions, had to await the present
period (see Chapters <a href='#ch22'>22</a> and <a href='#ch25'>25</a>). Once again French influence had a
significant role to play. But between the arrival of Grandjean de
Montigny in 1816 and Le Corbusier’s first visit to South America in
1929 that continent took little part in the major architectural
developments of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. On the other
hand, the United States, building on the professional foundations laid
by Latrobe and exploiting to the full new structural materials and
methods, rose before the nineteenth century was over to a position of
world leadership (see Chapters <a href='#ch13'>13</a>, <a href='#ch14'>14</a>, and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>What is true of Latin America is not altogether untrue of the British Dominions in the
New World and at the Antipodes, as also of various British Colonies throughout the rest
of the world. No French architects were imported, of course, and the links with England
remained very close and strong. As in all colonial situations, however, the transfer
of new ideas from the homeland was slow and inefficient and the capacity of <i>émigré</i>
architects usually rather low. No Latrobes or Havilands seem to have gone to the
Dominions; and the Greek Revival was hardly accepted before the forties, when it was
already passing out of favour in the United States.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first professional to work in Australia, Francis Greenway (1777-1837), who
arrived in Sydney in 1814 as a convict and almost at once became Governor Macquarie’s
architect, remained faithful in most of his public work to the modes of his eighteenth-century
youth in Bristol. But his house of 1822 for Robert Campbell, Jr, in Bligh Street
in Sydney showed that he had real skill as a designer of up-to-date Regency villas.
Canada had no early architect of comparable ability to serve the British community.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the western world expanded in the nineteenth century, significant architectural
achievement tended to move outwards from the old centres on the Tiber, the Seine,
and the Thames; but that movement was always very uneven, and still remains so today.
Russia was building more and finer structures of Western European character
than Spain and Portugal; while the United States, not yet fantastically disparate in
size and population, produced many more productive Romantic Classical architects than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>either Holland or Sweden. All the same, the architectural leadership of the western
world remained for at least a generation longer in the old centres of Europe; our story
must return to where it started in order to proceed beyond the mid century or even to
complete the account of the period 1810-50.</p>

<p class='c010'>Romantic Classicism came to no sudden end. If in Vienna a monumental Grecian
Parliament house could rise as late as the seventies, so in the desert of Arizona the Crystal
Palace Saloon of 1878 at Tombstone is still in the Greek Revival vernacular. From the
very first, on the other hand, there was some admixture of the Picturesque in Romantic
Classicism. Almost all the architects that have been mentioned, both of the earlier and of
the later generation, were more eclectic in their practice and even in their theories than
this account of their major works has made altogether evident. But in the main, down
into the forties, Romantic Classicism, while increasingly eclectic, remained a coherent
style whose canons controlled most of the accepted variants to the Grecian.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dissolution of the dominant stylistic discipline, hardly completed even in the
fifties, had nevertheless begun very early indeed. In terms of historical significance, if
not of absolute achievement, the Picturesque rises rapidly in comparative importance
from the time of Wyatt’s Fonthill Abbey in the 1790s. Beside Soane’s crisp Bank interiors
it is necessary to carry in the mind’s eye the prophetic image which his renderer
J. M. Gandy (1771-1843) provided of them as a Romantic ruin; nor should the vast
dream-like Gothic cathedrals that Schinkel made the centre of some of his early paintings
be forgotten in the cool presence of his Grecian Schauspielhaus and Museum. Fortunately
no one is likely in looking at Barry’s <i>palazzi</i> to forget that they are contemporary
with his Gothic Houses of Parliament; one does, however, tend to forget that the
career of his associate Pugin as protagonist of the mature Gothic Revival ended well
before Barry’s did as the chief English protagonist of the Renaissance Revival. Earlier
the Gothic Revival was hardly more than a special aspect of the Picturesque; with Pugin,
however, it became a major movement in its own right and actually anti-Picturesque in
theory, if rarely so in practice. To a considerable extent, moreover, the Gothic Revival
usurped during the forties the centre of the stage in England, if hardly to the same
degree in other countries even in the following decades.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c013'><span class='c027'>CHAPTER 6</span><br />THE PICTURESQUE AND THE GOTHIC REVIVAL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> principal modern treatise on the Picturesque with a capital P, Christopher Hussey’s
of 1927, is subtitled ‘Studies in a Point of View’. By the opening years of the nineteenth
century the term had come to have a far more precise, if also a more complex, meaning
than the adjective ‘picturesque’ as it is generally used today. But Hussey is perfectly
correct: the Picturesque is no more a style than is the Sublime, it <i>is</i> a point of view.
That point of view nevertheless influenced architecture<a id="r105"></a><a href='#f105' class='c025'><sup>[105]</sup></a> increasingly as the first half of
the nineteenth century wore on. It had a solvent, and eventually a destructive, effect
on the dominant Romantic Classical style as has already been suggested in discussing the
later work of various leading architects in several countries.</p>
<p class='c010'>The Picturesque had its early eighteenth-century origins<a id="r106"></a><a href='#f106' class='c025'><sup>[106]</sup></a> in England, and its most
notable theorists were English. In the first quarter of the century, moreover, there was
no British architect so resolutely Grecian that he did not, either on his own initiative or
in deference to his clients’ wishes, experiment with alternative modes in conscious pursuit
of the Picturesque. Despite the stringencies of the Greek Revival as represented,
early, in Wilkins’s Downing College or, later, in Smirke’s British Museum, Smirke had
built several Castellated mansions in the years before Waterloo and Wilkins the Gothic
screen and the hall range at King’s College, Cambridge, in the twenties; while at the
National Gallery in the thirties he handled standard Classical elements in a markedly
Picturesque way. Nash was the initiator of one characteristically Picturesque mode, the
asymmetrically towered Italian Villa, at Cronkhill in 1802; he also exploited in
an exemplary way another longer-established one, the Rustic Cottage, in Blaise
Hamlet in 1811 (Plate <a href='#pl050a'>50<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The score or more of Castellated mansions that Nash built
were always Picturesque and irregular whether their detailing was Norman<a id="r107"></a><a href='#f107' class='c025'><sup>[107]</sup></a> or some
sort of Gothic. Above all, he handled the urbanistic development which was his greatest
achievement in a thoroughly Picturesque way. Soane’s Picturesque was of a less usual
order and his personal tendency was as much or more towards the Sublime, otherwise
a largely forgotten category after 1810.</p>

<p class='c010'>But from 1810 on new buildings in which the basic principles of Romantic Classicism
were ignored and exotic stylistic alternatives to the Grecian exploited were generally
larger, more prominent, and also more creatively original than they had ever been before.
C. A. Busby (1788-1838) was responsible as late as 1827 for one of the finest, most
formal, and most extensive examples of Romantic Classical urbanism, Kemp Town at
Brighton. Yet in 1814 he exhibited at the Royal Academy his design for Gwrych Castle,
completed in 1815, which he was building in North Wales near Abergele, presumably in
collaboration with his client, Lloyd Bamford Hesketh, a notable amateur (Plate <a href='#pl049'>49</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The next year Nash began for the Regent the transformation of his favourite residence,
the Royal Pavilion<a id="r108"></a><a href='#f108' class='c025'><sup>[108]</sup></a> at Brighton. This was at that time an elegant early example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of a Romantic Classical house as first remodelled and enlarged by Henry Holland<a id="r109"></a><a href='#f109' class='c025'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
(1745-1806) just before the Napoleonic Wars began. Nash now made of it an extraordinary
oriental confection (as had already been proposed by Repton<a id="r110"></a><a href='#f110' class='c025'><sup>[110]</sup></a> in 1806). Part
Chinese, part Saracenic, and part Indian, this is quite in the spirit of Porden’s earlier
Dome near by (Plate <a href='#pl048'>48</a>). Festive and frivolous, the Pavilion resembles an oversized
garden fabrick or sumptuously ornamented marquee; but the scale is fully architectural,
even monumental, both externally and in the principal apartments. Not least interesting
is Nash’s frank use of visible iron elements. These are not masonry-scaled like the
columns he employed later in the Regent Street Quadrant and on Carlton House Terrace,
but delicate and playfully decorative. The pierced ‘Chinese’ staircases of 1815-18
have naturalistically coloured bamboo detailing and the tops of the four columns that
carry the monitor over the kitchen of 1818-21 are embellished with copper palm-leaves
(Plate <a href='#pl058a'>58<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pavilion had no real sequel; even the Regent, King as George IV from 1820, tired
of it almost as soon as it was finished. Indeed, he forsook Brighton for good in 1823 just
as the general building activity there,<a id="r111"></a><a href='#f111' class='c025'><sup>[111]</sup></a> commonly but incorrectly called ‘Regency’, was
getting under way. Turning his attention to Windsor Castle, the King employed Sir
Jeffrey Wyatville (1776-1840) to remodel the accumulated mass of heterogeneous
construction there into a Picturesque mansion of the Castellated sort in which the
real medieval elements were quite submerged. But Windsor, being much more obviously
a remodelling than was the Pavilion when Nash completed it, is not a very
exemplary specimen of a fake castle. Busby’s Gwrych, set against a hanging wood, its
round and square towers simply detailed and tightly though asymmetrically composed,
is a better instance of that abstract sculptural massing which critics of the mid century
would sometimes define as ‘architecturesque’ (Plate <a href='#pl049'>49</a>). For this sort of three-dimensional
composition the Italian Villa mode provided on the whole a better vehicle.
Wyatville, for example, did his best to turn the vast regular mass of late seventeenth-century
Chatsworth<a id="r112"></a><a href='#f112' class='c025'><sup>[112]</sup></a> into a more Picturesque adjunct to its landscape setting by
Capability Brown (1715-83), by adding a long service wing on the north side and terminating
that with a very large and tall loggia-topped tower.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well before George IV undertook the remodelling of Windsor, a relatively modest
mansion linked the Castellated mode more closely to the rising enthusiasm for the
Middle Ages. The author of the immensely popular Waverley novels, Sir Walter Scott,
employed Blore in 1816 to build Abbotsford near Melrose in Roxburghshire in this
vein—it was much extended along the same lines by William Atkinson (<i>c.</i> 1773-1839)
in 1822-3. With its definitely Scottish features Abbotsford initiated a special mode, the
Scottish Baronial, that eventually received Royal sanction when Queen Victoria acquired
Balmoral Castle near Ballater in 1848, a modest residence built in the late thirties
by John Smith of Aberdeen. At the time she and Prince Albert first occupied this Scottish
retreat Balmoral was quite small, but it was reconstructed in 1853-5 on a vastly
larger scale in the same Scottish Baronial mode by William Smith, son of the original
architect, working in close collaboration with Prince Albert. Thus the Queen’s two
private residences, Osborne and Balmoral, both in part at least designed by the Consort,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>illustrated—in neither case very happily—the two major types of determinedly Picturesque
design for edifices of some consequence, the Italian Villa and the Castellated;
the viability of the Rustic Cottage mode was necessarily rather limited and hardly suitable
for Royal use.</p>

<p class='c010'>Castellated design was not restricted to the field of country-house building. At Conway,
in Wales, the engineer Thomas Telford (1757-1834) in his suspension bridge of 1819-24
and, after him, Robert Stephenson and his associated architect Francis Thompson in the
tubular bridge<a id="r113"></a><a href='#f113' class='c025'><sup>[113]</sup></a> there of 1845-9 castellated the piers out of deference to the nearby thirteenth-century
Castle. Another example of Engineers’ Castellated is the first Temple
Meads Railway Station at Bristol, built in 1839-40 by I. K. Brunel (1806-59). Brunel,
however, had preferred Egyptian forms for the piers of the Clifton Suspension Bridge<a id="r114"></a><a href='#f114' class='c025'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
near Bristol that he designed in 1829.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat more appropriately, prisons were likely to be Castellated in the forties and
fifties, thus echoing the design as well as the planning of Haviland’s Eastern Penitentiary
in Philadelphia. The Reading Gaol of 1842-4 by Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-78)
and his partner W. B. Moffatt (1812-87) and the Holloway Gaol in London of 1851-2
by J. B. Bunning (1802-63) are the most striking examples. Both are essentially Picturesque
essays; but by the time the latter was built the accepted standards of fake-castle
building had entirely changed. The reconstruction of Alton Castle in Staffordshire,
about 1840, by A. W. N. Pugin (1812-52) was archaeological in intention; even more
archaeological is Peckforton Castle in Shropshire, newly erected by Anthony Salvin
(1799-1881) in 1846-50, and his extensive ‘restoration’ of Alnwick Castle in Northumberland
carried out in the next decade. Thanks to its magnificent hill-top site and its
present state of disrepair, Peckforton is in fact notably Picturesque; but the fine, hard,
structurally expressive detailing of the beautiful pink sandstone may almost be considered
anti-Picturesque—contemporaries praised it for its ‘realism’.</p>

<p class='c010'>The welter of alternative Picturesque modes is most entertainingly epitomized in the
model village of Edensor,<a id="r115"></a><a href='#f115' class='c025'><sup>[115]</sup></a> built by Joseph Paxton in 1839-42 at Chatsworth. He was
probably assisted by John Robertson, a draughtsman for that encyclopaedist of the Picturesque,
J. C. Loudon.<a id="r116"></a><a href='#f116' class='c025'><sup>[116]</sup></a> One particular mode, however, had begun to take the
lead even before this ‘point of view’ came closest to dominance in the early decades of
the new century. The use of Gothic<a id="r117"></a><a href='#f117' class='c025'><sup>[117]</sup></a> for new churches was common enough from the
mid eighteenth century. Down to about 1820, however, this was usually done without
much archaeological pretension. The mood of the protagonists of what was then called
‘Gothick’, whether architects or clients, was not very serious. Architects lacked accurate
illustrations of old work such as the volumes of Stuart and Revett and other similar
treatises were providing for the Grecian. In the first two decades of the new century the
more thorough and general study of ancient Gothic monuments in England and the
handsome publications of John Britton (1771-1857)<a id="r118"></a><a href='#f118' class='c025'><sup>[118]</sup></a> and of Nash’s Gothic specialist,
the elder Pugin,<a id="r119"></a><a href='#f119' class='c025'><sup>[119]</sup></a> were gradually changing the situation. Thomas Rickman (1776-1841),
a pharmacist turned medievalist, began to put his knowledge<a id="r120"></a><a href='#f120' class='c025'><sup>[120]</sup></a> of old churches
to practical use; his St George’s, Birmingham, built 1819-21, is a not unsuccessful
essay in revived Perpendicular. Several others had built or were building by this time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>churches whose relationship to monuments of the medieval past was about as close as
that of most of the contemporary Grecian work to its ancient models. St Mary’s,
Bathwick, in Bath, of 1814-20 is at once very early and exceptionally well-scaled. The
local architect John Pinch (1770-1827) even vaulted it throughout in Bath stone.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ultimate purging away of the frivolity of Georgian Gothick detail and the effective
substitution of archaeological for Picturesque ideals in over-all composition was by
no means always a gain. In two later Birmingham churches, St Peter’s, Dale End, of
1825-7, and Bishop Ryder’s of 1837-8, Rickman did not improve on St George’s, while
St Luke’s, Chelsea, built in London by James Savage (1779-1852) in 1819-25, despite its
great size and its stone vaulting, is as cold and dry as the Grecian churches of the day and
quite inferior to Pinch’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Edward Garbett’s Holy Trinity, Theale, of 1820-5—with tower added after the
architect’s death by John Buckler (1770-1851) in 1827-8—is rather more interesting and
also premonitory of what was coming. Here the detail, imitated from Salisbury Cathedral,
is thirteenth-century in character, not fifteenth-sixteenth-century, as in the churches of
Pinch, Rickman, and Savage. Moreover, Theale is more boldly scaled and more plastically
handled altogether than are theirs. The placing of the tower, far to the rear on the
south side, while more Picturesque in its asymmetry than the standard position at the
centre of the west front, is also an archaeological echo of the free-standing tower which
still existed then beside Salisbury Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most Gothic churches built in the twenties and thirties under the Act of 1818—Commissioners’
Churches as they are called—were neither very satisfyingly Picturesque nor
at all archaeological. The usual reason for preferring Gothic to Grecian, indeed, was to
save money by avoiding the need for expensive stone porticoes! Barry’s Commissioners’
Churches around Manchester and in north-eastern London are among the better
examples; but only his St Peter’s, Brighton, of 1824-6 (not financed by the parsimonious
Commissioners) is at all elaborate. Among the most successful contemporary examples
are several by one of Soane’s pupils, R. D. Chantrell, at Leeds. His Christ Church there
of 1823-6 has considerable spatial grandeur in its tall nave and aisles, while the Perpendicular
detailing is rich and even fairly plausible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Generally preferable to the ecclesiastical Gothic of this decade is the collegiate work;
of this more exists both at Oxford and at Cambridge than is generally realized. At
King’s College, Cambridge, Wilkins’s Gothic screen fronting the quadrangle and the
hall range at right angles to it are not altogether unworthy of the magnificent Perpendicular
chapel and Gibbs’s Fellows Building that form the other two sides. Wilkins won
the competition for this work in 1823, and it was all completed by 1827. Still more
appealing, because an effectively independent entity, is Rickman’s New Court at St
John’s College, also at Cambridge,<a id="r121"></a><a href='#f121' class='c025'><sup>[121]</sup></a> built by him with the aid of his pupil Henry
Hutchinson (1800-31) in 1825-31 (Plate <a href='#pl050b'>50<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This is
not very plausibly Gothic perhaps, but the papery planes of the
light-coloured ashlar walls of the
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped
quadrangle, now richly hung with creeper, form an eligibly Picturesque
composition above and behind the open gallery across the south side
despite their total symmetry.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the thirties standards of Gothic design were generally rising, both in the greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>degree of plausibility attained by the leading practitioners and in their more positive
command of various borrowed idioms. Thus Barry’s King Edward’s Grammar School
in Birmingham, designed in 1833 and built 1834-7, seems to have been a rather satisfactory
Neo-Tudor design, notably Barryesque in the breadth of the composition and in
the use of strong terminal features. This building was unusually literate in detail owing
to the assistance of the younger Pugin, who was just about to make a tremendous personal
reputation as a Gothic expert thanks to his books.<a id="r122"></a><a href='#f122' class='c025'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Pugin’s <i>Contrasts</i>, published 1836, marks a turning point even more than does the
acceptance in that year of Barry’s Gothic design for the Houses of Parliament. Newly
converted to Catholicism, Pugin believed the building of Gothic churches to be a
religious necessity. His programme of Gothic Revival was far more stringent than any
existing programme of Greek Revival or, <i>a fortiori</i>, of Renaissance Revival. If the Gothic
were really to be revived, Pugin saw that its basic principles must be understood and
accepted. Merely to copy Gothic forms was as futile, and to him as immoral, as merely
to copy Grecian or <i>cinquecento</i> ones. The methods of building of the Middle Ages must
be revived; architecture must again derive its character, in what he considered to have
been the true medieval way, from the direct expression of structure; and at the same time
it must serve the complicated ritual-functional needs of revived medieval church practices.</p>

<p class='c010'>In some ways Pugin’s ideas are closely parallel to those of the most rationalistic
Romantic Classical theorists in France; doubtless they could be traced back, through his
father, to French eighteenth-century sources (see Introduction). However, Pugin’s
primary motivation was devotional and sacramental. Approaching all matters of building
with passion, he could not but reject the frivolous emphasis on visual qualities that
had always been characteristic of the Picturesque point of view.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mature Gothic Revival that began with Pugin, essentially an English manifestation
despite its presumptive French background and carried eventually wherever English
culture extended—as far as the West Coast of the United States and to the remotest
Antipodes—grew out of the Picturesque yet is itself basically anti-Picturesque. One
must build in a certain way because it is right to do so, not because the results are agreeable
to the eye. The Gothic Revival thus came to be, for about a decade, as absolute as
the most doctrinaire sort of Grecian Classicism. When the Anglicans of the Established
Church just after 1840 took over and began to apply rigidly the principles of the
Catholic Pugin, a new church-architecture came into being. This is quite as characteristic
of the nineteenth century as is Romantic Classicism, even though the mode was—nominally
at least—entirely dependent on English medieval Gothic of the fourteenth
century. Within a decade, however, Puginian Gothic, after being accepted and codified
by the Cambridge Camden Society,<a id="r123"></a><a href='#f123' class='c025'><sup>[123]</sup></a> developed into a much more original mode, the
High Victorian Gothic, very remote indeed from the models which Pugin had recommended
as providing the only proper precedents for the Revival (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Here it will be well to consider two exceptional Gothic monuments, designed in the
late thirties and built in the forties, one very large, the other rather small, which did <i>not</i>
follow the new Puginian standards, even though in the case of one of them Pugin collaborated
on the design from the first. The most Picturesque addition to the Romantic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Classical scene in Edinburgh, curiously effective by contrast with the big-scaled and
very cold Grecian structures near by, is the Sir Walter Scott Monument in Prince’s
Street Gardens (Plate <a href='#pl051'>51</a>). This was designed in 1836 and executed in 1840-6 by G.
Meikle Kemp<a id="r124"></a><a href='#f124' class='c025'><sup>[124]</sup></a> (1795-1844). His project had originally been placed below both
Fowler’s and Rickman’s in a competition; as the local contender, however, he had eventually
obtained the commission in 1838. The lacy elaboration of this florid shrine, if less
appropriate to Sir Walter’s own brand of medievalism than Abbotsford, is certainly in
the richest Late Georgian tradition of the Picturesque.</p>

<p class='c010'>Picturesque also are certain aspects of the Houses of Parliament, notably the contrast in
shape and placing of the two towers at the ends and, above all, the silhouette of the
Clock Tower, almost certainly one of Pugin’s personal contributions to the design
(Plate <a href='#pl054'>54</a>). But essentially the Houses of Parliament, as might be expected of Barry,
their architect, are one of the grandest academic productions of the nineteenth century.
Summerson has suggested a relationship to Fonthill Abbey in the way the plan is organized
round a central octagon; there may also be an echo of Wyatville’s east front of
Windsor in the composition of the river front. But except for the incorporation of the
medieval Westminster Hall, the Crypt Chapel, and the Cloister Court, which necessitated
irregularity along the landward side, the plan is almost as regular and as classically
logical in its balanced provision for multiple functions as a pupil<a id="r125"></a><a href='#f125' class='c025'><sup>[125]</sup></a> of Durand might
have developed. Equally regular are the façades and, in the case of the principal front
towards the river, elaborately symmetrical as well.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rich Late Gothic detail was provided in incredible profusion by Pugin, who
worked under Barry against his own developing taste for earlier and less lacy Gothic
forms. Doubtless, like the towers, this detailing reflects the Picturesque, but the extreme
regularity of the façades provides also the characteristic reiterations of Romantic Classicism.
Pugin is supposed to have said that the river front was ‘all Greek’, a considerable
exaggeration. But just as Highclere shows what Barry’s basic principles of design could
produce when expressed in the revived Jacobethan mode, so without too great a strain
one can imagine this front executed with some sort of Renaissance detailing, if hardly in
columnar Grecian guise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Commissioned in 1836, the Houses of Parliament rose slowly. The House of Lords
was opened in 1847; the House of Commons only in 1852, the year of Pugin’s early death.
Even at the time of Barry’s death in 1860 the whole group was still not finished, although
his eldest son (Edward Middleton, 1830-80) made but few personal contributions
when he took over control and finally completed the job later in the decade. During this
extended period of about thirty years the Puginian phase of the Gothic Revival had been
initiated and run its entire course; even the succeeding High Victorian Gothic was more
than half-way over by the mid sixties. Like the Napoleonic monuments of Paris, which
were also a generation a-building, the Houses of Parliament belong historically to the
period of their beginning. They are not quite pre-Victorian, since construction above
ground began only in 1840 after considerable revision of the competition design, but
they are definitely Early Victorian.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not all of Pugin’s own work is as remote in character from the Houses of Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>as his mature principles would lead one to expect. His first church of any consequence,
St Marie’s, Derby, of 1838-9, is Perpendicular in style and very crisp and flat in treatment.
Nevertheless, both in its detailed ‘correctness’ and in Pugin’s real command of
the national Late Gothic idiom, this church marks a great advance over the work of
Rickman and the other Gothic architects of the older generation who were still in practice.
Scarisbrick Hall in Lancashire, a remodelling, is confused by the retention of earlier
elements and also by a considerable addition made by Pugin’s son (Edward Welby,
1834-75) in the sixties. But the portions carried out in 1837-52 are quite consonant with
Pugin’s work done in association with Barry. The great hall is a definitely archaeological
feature of the plan yet also a feature that would be of great significance in the later
development of the nineteenth-century house (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>If Scarisbrick is not exactly <i>anti</i>-Picturesque, comparison with such a great house as Harlaxton
near Grantham, first designed by Salvin in the Jacobethan mode in 1831 and rising
under Burn’s supervision from 1838 on, reveals how little the Picturesque really influenced
Pugin even at the beginning of his career. However, Neo-Tudor Lonsdale Square in
London, begun by R. C. Carpenter (1812-55) in 1838, is still less Picturesque than Scarisbrick
because of its extreme regularity. This example makes evident how far other young
architects—and Carpenter was precisely Pugin’s contemporary—were behind him in understanding
and exploiting even Late Gothic forms; yet within a very few years Carpenter
became the most ‘correct’ of Anglican church architects by following Pugin’s lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1839 and 1840 Pugin designed two modest churches that provided favourite paradigms
for Anglo-American church-building for a generation and more. St Oswald’s,
Old Swan, Liverpool, built in 1840-2, adopts the fourteenth-century English parish-church
plan with central western tower broach-spired, aisles, deep chancel, and south
porch, each element being quite clearly expressed in the external composition. Internally
the effect is low and dark, since Pugin provided no clerestory, roofed the nave with
much exposed timber, and filled the traceried windows with stained glass. More
original is St Wilfred’s, Hulme, Manchester, built in 1839-42, in that the tower—never
completed, alas—was set at the north-west corner. The detail of St Oswald’s is fairly
elaborate, including a rather rich east window. St Wilfred’s is simpler, with lancet windows
to avoid the expense of fourteenth-century tracery.</p>

<p class='c010'>A larger, more complete, and more expensively decorated example of the Old Swan
model was St Giles’s, Cheadle, of 1841-6 (Plate <a href='#pl052a'>52<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). This has a quite magnificent, if
hardly very original, spired tower and interior walls all patterned in colour. Here Lord
Shrewsbury, Pugin’s most important patron, provided sufficient funds to furnish the
church as the architect intended. Pugin’s largest churches, unfortunately, never received
the carved work, stained glass, and painted decoration that he planned for them. At St
Barnabas’s, Nottingham, now the Catholic Cathedral there, of 1842-4 he achieved externally
a rather fine piling up of related masses at the rear, the whole crowned by a
central tower. For lack of any decoration, however, this is grim without and barren
within, despite all the spatial interest of the very complex east end.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pugin, always his own severest critic, was most nearly satisfied with the church that he
built for himself next door to his own house, the Grange, at Ramsgate.<a id="r126"></a><a href='#f126' class='c025'><sup>[126]</sup></a> The house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>dates from 1841-3, the church from 1846-51. Externally of Kentish knapped flint and
internally of Caen stone with a very heavy roof of dark oak, this edifice is worthy of his
highest standards of revived medieval construction. But it is rather less original and interesting
in external massing and internal spatial development than such a big bare
church as St Barnabas’s. To the house we will be returning later (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Pugin’s production is largely concentrated in the years 1837-44, between the two
periods of his employment by Barry on the Houses of Parliament. By 1844 other architects,
Anglican and not Roman Catholic, were accepting his principles and rivalling his
success. G. G. Scott, for example, never a really great architect but a notable self-publicist,
after modest beginnings designed the Martyrs’ Memorial at Oxford in 1841
in the form of a fourteenth-century Eleanor Cross and followed up that prominent
commission by building the large suburban London church of St Giles’s, Camberwell, in
1842-4. At that time he was still in partnership with Moffatt. Then, in 1844, he signalized
the international standing of the English Gothic Revival by winning alone the competition
for the Nikolaikirche in Hamburg, which he carried to completion over the
years 1845-63.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although the body of this church was all but completely destroyed by bombs, the
tower and spire still dominate the Hamburg skyline (Plate <a href='#pl052b'>52<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). It is interesting to compare
this grand scenic accent with the tower and spire of the Petrikirche, almost equally
prominent, built in 1843-9 by de Chateauneuf and Fersenfeld (Plate <a href='#pl057a'>57<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Although
built, with a curious echo of London’s characteristic stock brick, of an unpleasantly yellowish
brick, while the Petrikirche is of a handsome deep-red brick like de Chateauneuf’s
Alte Post, the silhouette is so enriched with elaborate fourteenth-century stonework—part
English, part German in derivation—that it almost rivals in richness of
effect Kemp’s Walter Scott Monument in Edinburgh. Yet the scale is grand, the parts
well related, and in every way it represents a more advanced, almost mid-century taste,
in contrast to the simplicity and the geometrical clarity of de Chateauneuf’s square brick
tower with its plain triangular gables and its very tall and svelte metal-clad spire.</p>

<p class='c010'>From 1845 down to 1855, when Henry Clutton (1819-93) and William Burges
(1827-81) won the competition for Lille Cathedral in France and G. E. Street (1824-81)
received the second prize, the pre-eminence of English architects at plausible revived
Gothic was generally recognized abroad. Though few of the innumerable churches
built by Scott and his rivals at home in the forties are in any way really memorable, by
the middle of that decade the characteristics of English church edifices had been completely
revised, largely thanks to the propaganda of the Cambridge Camden Society.
There is no more typical nineteenth-century product than a Victorian Gothic church of
this period built to the Camdenian canon; yet the real achievement of the most original
architect who designed such churches, Butterfield, belongs to the next, or High Victorian,
phase (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>). The more Puginian Carpenter, the other favourite architect
of the Society, who died in 1855, is hardly as interesting a designer—however ‘correct’
he may be—in such prominent works as St Paul’s in West Street, Brighton, of
1846-8 and St Mary Magdalen’s, Munster Square, in London of 1849-51, as in what he
built for Lancing College in 1851-3. There the plain high-roofed ranges with their fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>smooth walls of knapped flint and very flat and simple cut-stone dressings have a quality
of precision quite lacking in most contemporary churches. Almost finer is St John’s
College, Hurstpierpoint, although largely posthumous in execution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Scott, Carpenter, and Butterfield all supplied designs for churches in various parts of
the British Empire; other English architects emigrated to the Dominions and to the
United States, carrying with them the doctrine of the Gothic Revival, just as French
architects half a century earlier had carried a rather different sort of doctrine all over the
western world. As a symbol of Britain’s major world position, moreover, English
churches now rose in many Continental cities, from German watering-places and
French Riviera towns to remote capitals such as Athens and Istanbul. Remarkably alien
in their foreign contexts, these express the vigour and the assurance, if rarely the real
creative possibilities, of the Victorian Gothic.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Established Church in England was the great patron of the revived Gothic, although
other denominations were not far behind. But the use of Gothic was by no
means confined to churches, nor indeed to country houses as it had largely been in the
late eighteenth century. No other Gothic public buildings rivalled the Houses of Parliament;
but in 1843-5 Philip Hardwick, designer of the most Grecian of railway stations,
with his son (P. C., 1822-92) built the Hall and Library of Lincoln’s Inn in London of
Tudor red brick with black brick diaperings and cream stone trim. This offered a foretaste
of the external polychromy which would be the sign-manual of the next period of
revived Gothic in England. An earlier, more severe, sort of Tudor, carried out in stone,
served Moffatt, Scott’s former partner, for a mansion at No. 19 Park Lane. But this
house was most exceptional; in the forties London architects and builders generally eschewed
Gothic of any sort except for churches. Generically medieval, if not specifically
Gothic, inspiration would eventually play a major part in forming the advanced commercial
mode of the late fifties and sixties however (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The success that Victorian Gothic, initiated by a Romanist and supported by the
Catholicizing wing of the Church of England, had with non-Anglicans in England and
throughout the English-speaking world is surprising. Ritualistic planning, almost the
essence of the Revival to Pugin and his Camdenian followers, was naturally avoided;
but the Gothic work of the best Nonconformist architects, such as the Independent
Church of 1852 in Glasgow by J. T. Emmett, is by no means unworthy of comparison
with Scott’s, if not the more puristic Carpenter’s. Samuel Hemming of Bristol even employed
a few touches of Gothic detail on the prefabricated cast-iron churches that he
exported all over the world from Bristol in the early fifties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mature Gothic Revival, as has been said, is more anti-Picturesque than Picturesque,
at least in the realm of theory; as a writer in <i>The Ecclesiologist</i> expressed the matter
succinctly, ‘The true picturesque derives from the sternest utility.’ Yet the revived
Gothic could only be expected to appeal widely to architects and to a public who had long
fully accepted the Picturesque point of view. All its irregularity and variety of silhouette,
its plastically complex organization and its colouristic decoration, its textural exploitation
of various traditional and even near-rustic materials is profoundly opposed to the
clear and cool ideals of Romantic Classicism, but fully consonant with the Picturesque.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>The significance of the English Gothic Revival of the thirties and forties is manifold,
and no two critics will agree how to assess it. Certainly the functional doctrines of the
Revival and its renewed devotion to honest expression of real construction remain of
great importance, even though much of this runs parallel to—if, indeed, it does not
follow from—the more rationalistic aspects of Romantic Classical theory. In this way
the Revival made a positive historical contribution, if not perhaps as new and original a
one as has sometimes been maintained in recent years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Negatively, the English Gothic Revival was clearly of very great effectiveness as a solvent,
not only of the rigidities and conventionalities of Romantic Classicism, but also of
the older and deeper Classical traditions that had been revived by the Renaissance and
maintained for several centuries. The lack of an equally effective solvent on the Continent
helps to explain why the revolutionary developments of the next period, particularly
in the domestic and in the commercial fields, were so largely Anglo-American.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even in the twentieth century it may be said that part of the profound difference between
a Wright and a Perret lay in the fact that one had the tradition of the English
Gothic Revival in his blood—largely through reading Ruskin—while the other had not
(see Chapters <a href='#ch18'>18</a> and <a href='#ch19'>19</a>). Still later, the California ‘Bay Region School’ of the 1930s
and 1940s implies a Gothic Revival background, however little its leaders may be aware
of the fact; the coeval ‘Carioca School’ of Brazil manifestly has no such background
(see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>). It is therefore of more consequence to see how the ideals of the Picturesque,
and concurrently the anti-Picturesque doctrines of the Gothic Revival, were
accepted in the United States, than to give comparable attention to Europe, where
neither the Picturesque nor the Gothic Revival were very productive of buildings of distinction.
For that matter, most of the American buildings that fall under these rubrics
are but feeble parodies of English originals. The Greek Revival architects of America
were no unworthy rivals of the Europeans of their day; the exponents of the Picturesque
and the followers of Pugin—sometimes the same men—produced little of lasting value.
But when seen in relation to the later development of the American house, the contribution
of the Picturesque period, lasting in America down to the Civil War and even
beyond, is of real significance (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>There was not much eighteenth- or very early nineteenth-century Gothick of consequence
in America. Latrobe’s Sedgeley of 1798, Strickland’s Masonic Hall in Philadelphia
of 1809-11, and Bulfinch’s contemporary Federal Street Church in Boston were
none of them of much intrinsic interest, and all are now destroyed. Other early manifestations
of the Picturesque were even rarer, and it was not until the thirties that a concerted
Gothic movement got under way. Haviland’s Eastern Penitentiary of 1821-9 was
very modestly Castellated; Strickland’s St Stephen’s in Philadelphia, a rather gaunt two-towered
red-brick structure of 1822-3, more or less Perpendicular, represents but a
slight advance in plausibility over his Masonic Hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>The finest works of the next decade are a group of churches in and around Boston, all
built of granite. Willard’s Bowdoin Street Church in Boston of 1830 and St Peter’s of
1833 and the First Unitarian or North Church of 1836-7, both in Salem, Mass., are the
best extant examples (Plate <a href='#pl055a'>55<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The material discouraged detail, but provided, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>used rock-faced, an almost antediluvian ruggedness. Tracery is generally of wood and
much simplified; the most characteristic decorative features are very plain crenellations
and occasional quatrefoil openings. Thus, on the whole, these monuments are closer
to Romantic Classicism than to the Picturesque and have little in common with English
work of their own day or even of the preceding period. However, the wooden Gothic
of this period is in general of a rather lacy Late Georgian order.<a id="r127"></a><a href='#f127' class='c025'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The mid thirties saw some quite elaborate Gothic houses of stone, such as A. J.
Davis’s Blythewood of 1834 at Annandale, N.Y., and Oaklands, built by Richard Upjohn
(1802-78) the next year at Gardiner, Maine. Both architects were capable of designing
at the very same time Greek edifices of considerably higher quality—Davis’s Indiana
State Capitol of 1831-5 at Indianapolis and Upjohn’s Samuel Farrer house of 1836 at
Bangor, Maine, for example—but both were already leaders in the rising revolt against
the Grecian.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upjohn’s Trinity Church in New York completed in 1846 is the American
analogue of Pugin’s St Marie’s, Derby, and by no means inferior
despite its plaster vaults (Plate <a href='#pl053a'>53<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). With Trinity to his credit
Upjohn, English-born but not English-trained, became the acknowledged
leader of the American ecclesiologists. At Kingscote, Newport, R.I.,
which he built in 1841, Upjohn also rivalled Davis as a designer of
Picturesque Gothic houses. But he was almost equally addicted to
Italianate forms, even in the church-building
field, for there his rigid ecclesiological principles made him unwilling to use
Gothic except for Episcopalians. His non-Gothic work ranges from a vague sort of
<i>Rundbogenstil</i>, as illustrated in his Congregational Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn
of 1844-6, once provided with a highly original spire of scalloped outline, and the more
Germanic Bowdoin College Chapel in Brunswick, Maine, of 1844-55, to Italian Villas,
such as that built in Newport, R.I., for Edward King in 1845-7 (now the Free Library),
and even to public buildings in the Italian Villa mode, such as his City Hall in Utica,
N.Y., of 1852-3 (Plate <a href='#pl053b'>53<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). His basilican St Paul’s in Baltimore, Maryland, of 1852-6—its
style is rather surprising, since the parish was Episcopalian—is more successful than
most of his later Gothic churches. His Corn Exchange Bank of 1854 in New York,
round-arched if not exactly <i>Rundbogenstil</i>, was one of the most distinguished early approaches
to the use of an arcaded mode for commercial building (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). Of
very similar character and comparable quality was the H. E. Pierrepont house in Brooklyn
completed in 1857.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Upjohn’s reputation, rightly or wrongly, is based on his Gothic churches. Externally
these are usually quite close to contemporary Camdenian models; internally
they are often distinguished by very original—and also very awkward—wooden arcades
rising up to the open wooden roofs above. St Mary’s, Burlington, NJ., of 1846-54 is
perhaps the most attractive and English-looking of his village churches, the modest
cruciform plan culminating in a very simple but delicate spire over the crossing. Not
least significant, moreover, are Upjohn’s still more modest wooden churches<a id="r128"></a><a href='#f128' class='c025'><sup>[128]</sup></a> of
vertical board-and-batten construction, such as St Paul’s in Brunswick, Maine, of
1845. They illustrate, like his openwork wooden arcades, a real interest in expressing the
stick character of American carpentry. This interest is intellectually similar to, but visually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>very different from, Pugin’s devotion to the direct expression of masonry construction.
At building churches in stone British immigrants like Notman and Frank Wills (1827-?)<a id="r129"></a><a href='#f129' class='c025'><sup>[129]</sup></a>
were not surprisingly Upjohn’s rivals in the quality of their craftsmanship.</p>

<p class='c010'>Running parallel with Upjohn’s career is that of Davis, but with the difference that he
built few churches and, as Ithiel Town’s former partner, continued on occasion, even
after the latter’s retirement in 1835, to provide Grecian as well as Gothic designs. He was
perhaps most successful, however, with Italian Villas such as the Munn house in Utica,
N.Y., or the E. C. Litchfield house in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, N.Y., both of 1854. At
Belmead, in Powhatan County, Virginia, built in 1845, he introduced Manorial Gothic
to the southern plantation, but this mode never rivalled the Grecian peripteral temple in
popularity in the South. Walnut Wood, the Harral house in Bridgeport, Conn., of
1846, was more typical and long retained all its original furnishings. With the building
of Ericstan, the John J. Herrick house in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 1855 Davis brought the
fake castle to the Hudson River valley—so frequently compared to that of the Rhine and
favourite subject in these years of a new American school of landscape painters of the
most Picturesque order. As a scenic embellishment Ericstan was not unlike the ruins that
Thomas Cole introduced in his most Romantic and imaginary landscapes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite Davis’s ranging activity, extending westward into Kentucky and Michigan,
elaborate Gothic houses, whether Castellated or manorially Tudor, were relatively rare
in the America of the forties and fifties. But a type of gabled cottage with a front veranda
and elaborate traceried barge-boards was rather popular. This is well represented by
the extant Henry Delamater house in Rhinebeck, N.Y., and also by that of William J.
Rotch of 1845 in New Bedford, Mass., both by Davis himself. The mode was energetically
supported by Davis’s great friend, the landscape gardener and architectural critic
A. J. Downing (1815-52).</p>

<p class='c010'>Downing was a characteristic proponent of the Picturesque point of view, leaning
heavily on earlier English writers. The designs for Picturesque houses, some by Davis,
some by Notman, one at least—the King Villa—by Upjohn, and others presumably by
himself, illustrated in Downing’s two house-pattern books<a id="r130"></a><a href='#f130' class='c025'><sup>[130]</sup></a> were quite as likely to be
towered Italian Villas as Tudor Cottages or more pretentiously Gothic designs. Most
significant of all are those called Bracketted Cottages by Downing for which he recommended
the board-and-batten<a id="r131"></a><a href='#f131' class='c025'><sup>[131]</sup></a> external finish that Upjohn later took up for modest
wooden churches. But these, which are neither very Picturesque—at least with the
capital P—nor yet at all Gothic, are better considered in relation to the general development
of Anglo-American house-design in the nineteenth century (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Rare in execution, as are indeed all the more exotic Picturesque modes, but also significant
for its later influence, was the Swiss Chalet. Although chalets were illustrated in
the English Villa books of P. F. Robinson (1776-1858)<a id="r132"></a><a href='#f132' class='c025'><sup>[132]</sup></a> and others from the twenties,
the finest extant American example is fairly late, the Willoughby house in Newport,
R.I., of 1854. As this is by Eidlitz, it may be presumed to derive from Swiss<a id="r133"></a><a href='#f133' class='c025'><sup>[133]</sup></a> or German
sources rather than from Robinson’s or other English designs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus at Newport, already rising towards its later position as the premier American
summer resort, there were by the time the Civil War broke out in the early sixties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>examples of the Tudor Cottage (Upjohn’s Kingscote), the towered Italian Villa (his
Edward King House)—as for that matter also the more Barryesque symmetrical villa
without tower, the Parish House of 1851-2 by the English-trained Calvert Vaux (1824-95)<a id="r134"></a><a href='#f134' class='c025'><sup>[134]</sup></a>—and
the Swiss Chalet, not to speak of other more formal houses which here
in Newport began to show very early the influence of the French Second Empire. There
were also several big hotels of this period, now all destroyed. Two Grecian examples
have been mentioned earlier; but the second Ocean House, built by Warren in 1845,
was Gothic, a gargantuan version of a Davis-Downing Tudor Cottage. On this the
Tudoresque veranda piers were carried to a fantastic height in naïve competition with
the columned porticoes of the previous Ocean House and the Atlantic House.</p>

<p class='c010'>If there were in America no castles of the scale and plausibility of Salvin’s Peckforton,
no pavilions of the pseudo-oriental magnificence of Nash’s at Brighton, the will to build
them was none the less present. Ericstan has already been mentioned; while at Bridgeport,
Conn., P. T. Barnum erected Iranistan in 1847-8 in conscious emulation of the
Regent’s pleasure dome at Brighton from designs he had obtained in England. This was
carried out by Eidlitz. Longwood, near Natchez, Mississippi, by Samuel Sloan (1815-84),
begun in 1860, is even more ambitiously oriental, but was left unfinished when
the Civil War broke out the next year.<a id="r135"></a><a href='#f135' class='c025'><sup>[135]</sup></a> Rather curiously the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, set down like an enormous garden fabrick in L’Enfant’s Mall near the
Mills obelisk, was at the insistence of its director, Robert Dale Owen,<a id="r136"></a><a href='#f136' class='c025'><sup>[136]</sup></a> designed as a
Norman castle by James Renwick (1818-95). Built in 1848-9 of brownstone, this is a
very monumental manifestation of the Picturesque and one of the more surprising
features of a capital otherwise mostly Classical in its architecture. On the whole the
happiest American achievements in the Picturesque vein were the towered Italian Villas,
from Notman’s Doane house of the mid thirties down through Upjohn’s City Hall in
Utica of the early fifties and Davis’s still later houses in the East and the Middle West
(see Chapter <a href='#ch05'>5</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Gothic Revival in America, deriving after 1840 from Pugin and the Camdenians,
was a much more alien movement than the Greek Revival. In the British Dominions
and Colonies, even though the characteristic production of this period is in many ways
more similar to that of the United States than to that of the homeland, the Neo-Gothic
achievement appears somewhat less exotic. However, St John’s in Hobart, Tasmania, by
John Lee Archer, which was completed in 1835 in the most rudimentary sort of Commissioners’
Gothic, is far inferior to the granite churches of its period in the Boston
area. From that to Holy Trinity in Hobart, completed by James Blackburn in 1847,
the advance in mere competence is very evident. Yet, as in the case of Upjohn in
America, the Norman church that Blackburn built for the Presbyterians of Glenorchy
and even more his Congregational Church at Newtown, an asymmetrically towered
Italian Villa edifice, may well be preferred to his Gothic work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Greenway’s Government House Stables of 1817-19 in Sydney, Australia, were already
Castellated, but in a modest eighteenth-century way. M. W. Lewis’s Camden church
of 1840-9 was based on plans sent out by Blore and simply executed in red brick. In
W. W. Wardell (1823-99), who emigrated as late as 1858, Australia finally obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>an experienced Neo-Gothic architect of real ability. He had already made his mark in
England a decade before his departure with Our Lady of Victories, Clapham, in London;
but even that very decent early church of his required no specific mention in the English
section of this chapter. His Australian work is too late to be considered here
(see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Across the Atlantic, communications were doubtless quicker than with the Antipodes,
and the cultural climate of Canada was undoubtedly more similar to that of the homeland.
The first important Neo-Gothic work in Canada, however, was built for the
French and not the British community. Notre Dame, the Catholic Cathedral of Montreal,
was originally designed and erected by an Irish architect, James O’Donnell (1774-1830),
in 1824-9 somewhat to the disgust of most French Canadians, who considered
O’Donnell’s Gothic to be Anglican when in fact it was merely Georgian. Equipped
later with western towers and redecorated internally with operatic sumptuousness in the
seventies, it is not easy to realize just what Notre Dame was like when O’Donnell completed
it. It was bigger, certainly, but not more advanced than the New England
churches of a few years later.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1845 Wills arrived in Canada from England and began the Anglican Cathedral
at Fredericton, New Brunswick, as a moderate-sized cruciform parish-church with
central tower, the whole of rather run-of-the-mill Camdenian character despite its pretensions.
Very similar, but considerably larger and richer, is the Montreal cathedral
which he began a decade later in 1856. His American churches, though smaller and less
elaborate, have somewhat more character. Canadians must have sensed Wills’s inadequacy
almost at once, for both Butterfield and G. G. Scott were asked to send out
church designs in the forties. The former provided in 1848 a scheme for a more elaborate
east end for Wills’s Fredericton Cathedral, which had been started only three years before.
Scott’s Cathedral in St John’s, Newfoundland, initiated in 1846, deserves a relatively
important place in the roster of his churches as Butterfield’s New Brunswick work
does not. But this large edifice was completed only some forty years later by his son
(G. G. II, 1839-97). Even the stone used here was imported from Scotland.</p>

<p class='c010'>As in the United States, there is plenty of more-or-less Gothic domestic work in
Canada, most of it relatively late. An early and rather pretentious secular edifice was the
so-called Old Building of Trinity College, Toronto, erected in 1851 by Kivas Tully
(1820-1905). This was a by no means incompetent example of Collegiate Gothic, but
more like Wilkins’s or Rickman’s work of the twenties at Cambridge than the advanced
Camdenian edifices of its own period. Canadian Neo-Gothic rose to a certain autochthonous
distinction only in the next period (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>If early illustrations of the Picturesque point of view and of the mature Gothic Revival
are on the whole of minor interest in the English-speaking world outside Great Britain,
that whole world from California to Tasmania was absorbing the propaganda of the
English exponents of the Picturesque and the Gothic Revival. This had its effect in the
succeeding period when the High Victorian Gothic of England was exploited to more
considerable purpose than the Neo-Gothic of the Early Victorian period. By the time a
great English critic came to the support of the Gothic Revival, John Ruskin (1819-1900),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>he had almost from the original publication of his <i>Seven Lamps of Architecture</i> in
1849 more readers beyond the seas than at home.<a id="r137"></a><a href='#f137' class='c025'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Neither the Picturesque nor the Gothic Revival has the same importance on the
Continent of Europe as in English-speaking countries. The Picturesque point of view
was carried abroad by the great British artistic invention of the eighteenth century, the
English garden—<i>jardin anglais</i>, <i>englischer Garten</i>, <i>giardino inglese</i>, <i>jardin inglès</i>, etc., to
muster the various well-established and revelatory foreign terms for the more or less
naturalistic mode that succeeded the architecturally ordered French gardens of the Le
Nôtre type. By 1800 the Picturesque was as familiar in theory as were the international
tenets of Romantic Classicism. But for all the garden fabricks that were built in Europe
in the English taste, the point of view tended to remain alien. Moreover, from the continuance
of Orléans Cathedral<a id="r138"></a><a href='#f138' class='c025'><sup>[138]</sup></a> in Gothic, ordered as early as 1707 by Louis XIV
though not finally finished until 1829, to Schinkel’s painted Gothic visions of the opening
of the nineteenth century, there is no lack of evidence of Continental interest in
Gothic forms. In France there was also a very considerable theoretical interest in Gothic
methods of construction that can hardly be matched in eighteenth-century England (see
Introduction). But there followed in the early decades of the nineteenth century no
such effective crystallization of an earlier dilettante interest in the Gothic as in England,
no popular fad for building fake castles, no flood of cheap Commissioners’ Churches.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet, in France as in England, a new and more serious phase of the Gothic Revival did
open in the late thirties, stimulated by the ideals of Catholic Revival of a series of writers
from Chateaubriand to Montalembert. No great Gothic public monument like the
Houses of Parliament in London was initiated in these years in Paris—nor for that matter
at any later date—but several churches designed around 1840 were at least intended to be
as exemplary as Pugin’s; they were also considerably more ambitious in their size and
their elaboration than most of those his Catholic clients and the Camdenians’ Anglican
ones were sponsoring in England at this point.</p>

<p class='c010'>A curious example of the change in taste is the Chapelle-Saint-Louis at Dreux.<a id="r139"></a><a href='#f139' class='c025'><sup>[139]</sup></a> The
original chapel was built in 1816-22 by an architect named Cramail (or Cramailler) as a
Classical rotunda to serve as the mausoleum of the Orléans family. In 1839 Louis Philippe
ordered its remodelling and enlargement in Gothic style by P.-B. Lefranc (1795-1856),
desiring thus to associate the Orleanist dynasty with the medieval glories of French
royalty in a manner already fashionable<a id="r140"></a><a href='#f140' class='c025'><sup>[140]</sup></a> with intellectuals to the left and to the right, if
not with many architects. The new exterior, completed in 1848 just as the Orléans rule
came to an end, is in a very lacy and unplausible sort of Gothick, not without a certain
still rather eighteenth-century Rococo charm but quite inharmonious with the Classical
interior. Like another Royal mausoleum of these years, the Chapelle-Saint-Ferdinand in
the Avenue Pershing in Neuilly, built in 1843 in memory of an Orléans prince who had
been killed in an accident near its site, the Chapelle-Saint-Louis has stained glass windows
designed in 1844 by no less an artist than Ingres. These are even less appropriate in
association with Lefranc’s Gothic than with the Romanesquoid mode that the elderly
Fontaine—who knew, like Talleyrand, how to maintain his position under several
successive regimes—used for the Neuilly chapel. They are hardly superior in quality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>moreover, to the glass, whether imported from Germany or produced locally, that was
being used in the early forties in England for Neo-Gothic churches.</p>

<p class='c010'>A more important Gothic project of this date than the Chapelle-Saint-Louis was that
for the large new Paris church of Sainte-Clotilde prepared in 1840 by F.-C. Gau (1790-1853),
German-born but a pupil of Lebas. Doubts as to the extensive use of iron proposed
by Gau held up the initiation of the construction of Sainte-Clotilde until 1846,
so that several provincial Neo-Gothic edifices of some consequence were executed first.
These may be compared, but only to their disadvantage, with Pugin’s churches of
around 1840 as regards their plausibility, their intrinsic architectonic qualities, and the
elegance of their detail. However, several of them are larger and more ambitious—being
Catholic churches in a Catholic country—than are even his various cathedrals.</p>

<p class='c010'>In any case the character of real Gothic architecture in France, as in most other European
countries, made unlikely a programme of revival based chiefly on parish churches
in the way of Pugin’s. The Continental Middle Ages had most notably produced cathedrals,
and it was for new churches of near-cathedral scale that the re-use of Gothic was
likely to be proposed. Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours, built by J.-E. Barthélémy (1799-1868)
in 1840-7 on the heights of Ste Cathérine above Rouen, opens the serious phase
of the Revival in France. It has a superb site and is best appreciated from a considerable
distance, but the silhouette is not happy and the execution is rather hard and cold. Saint-Nicholas
at Nantes was begun in 1839 just before the Rouen church by L.-A. Piel
(1808-41), a confused Romantic character who died a monk, and taken over in 1843
by J.-B.-A. Lassus (1807-57), a pupil of Lebas and Henri Labrouste. It is very hard to
accept this church as even in part the production of Lassus, the erudite archaeologist who
brought out in 1842 the first volume of a major monograph on Chartres Cathedral and
who undertook in 1845, together with the better-known E.-E. Viollet-le-Duc (1814-79),
the restoration of Notre-Dame in Paris after sharing with Duban the responsibility
for restoring the Sainte-Chapelle. Rather more plausible—at least in the sense that it
merges fairly successfully with the original fourteenth-century nave to which it is
attached—is the façade of Saint-Ouen at Rouen built in 1845-51 by H.-C.-M. Grégoire
(1791-1854), a pupil of Percier.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sainte-Clotilde was finally begun in 1846, as has been noted, and completed after
Gau’s death by Ballu in 1857 (Plate <a href='#pl055b'>55<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This ambitious urban church of cathedral
scale lacks almost as completely as those just mentioned the personal qualities of design
and the integrity of revived medieval craftsmanship that give character, if not always
distinction, to the churches of Pugin, Carpenter, and other leading English Gothic Revivalists
of the forties. Nor does it have the grandeur of proportion of Scott’s Nikolaikirche
in Hamburg, to which it is more comparable in size and pretension (Plate <a href='#pl052b'>52<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
The style is Rayonnant, or French fourteenth-century, and the material good freestone,
but deadly mechanical and quite characterless in the detailing. The parts seem somehow
too large for the whole. Ballu’s west towers, for example, are excessively tall for so
stubby a plan, and the chapel-surrounded chevet is too elaborate for even an urban
parish church.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two later churches by Lassus, Saint-Nicholas at Moulins, built in collaboration with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>L.-D.-G. Esmonnot (1807-80) in 1849, and Saint-Pierre at Dijon of 1853 hardly rival
Sainte-Clotilde in size, elaboration, or even plausibility. Viollet-le-Duc was rather more
of an executant architect than Lassus, even though in this decade and the next most of
his vast energy and very considerable archaeological knowledge went into the restoration
of medieval monuments. At Notre-Dame in Paris the Chapter House that he designed
is a wholly new construction of 1847 not unworthy of comparison with the best
work of Scott in these years. The block of flats (Plate <a href='#pl056'>56</a>) he built at 28 Rue de Berlin
(now de Liège) in Paris in 1846-8—his first executed building—may better be compared
with the most advanced English secular Gothic of its date, Salvin’s Peckforton, say, or
Butterfield’s St Augustine’s College, Canterbury. The front is so simple and straightforward
in composition that it fits between more conventional façades with no awkwardness,
and the rather plain detailing has the ‘realism’ that was coming to be
admired by this date in the most advanced English circles.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Romanesquoid design of Fontaine’s Chapelle-Saint-Ferdinand of 1843 has been
mentioned. The use of such forms was in the forties even more exceptional in France
than in England. In 1852 Didron estimated—probably with some exaggeration—that
over two hundred Neo-Gothic churches had been built or were building in France, a
record which compares statistically, if in no other way, with English church production
in this period. None of them, however, is as impressive to later eyes as Saint-Paul at
Nîmes, which follows with notable success the alternative Romanesquoid mode of Fontaine’s
chapel. C.-A. Questel (1807-88), a pupil of Blouet and Duban, the architect of
this church, had evidently studied the Romanesque with the care and enthusiasm usually
lavished on the Gothic by his generation, and the result is so great an advance over Fontaine’s
work that the resemblance is merely nominal. Thus might the Camdenians have
hoped to build had they considered the twelfth-century Romanesque of France as
worthy of conscientious emulation as the fourteenth-century Gothic of England. Saint-Paul
is a large cruciform edifice, rib-vaulted throughout in a proto-Gothic way, and
crowned with a great central lantern. The detail is plausible in its design, neither too
skimpy nor too elaborate, although the execution lacks any real feeling for medieval
craftsmanship in stone. Questel’s church, however, is as much of an exception as Fontaine’s
chapel. No Romanesque Revival got under way in the forties in France in the
way that one did to a certain extent in Germany, and the few other Romanesquoid
churches of high quality belong to the next period (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Minor evidence of French interest—and rising interest—in the Picturesque is not hard
to find in these decades, but that is all there is. No Picturesque modes comparable to
those of the Anglo-Saxon world became widely popular. In the first decade of the century
the brothers Caccault built at Clisson<a id="r141"></a><a href='#f141' class='c025'><sup>[141]</sup></a> in the Vendée a whole village based on
their memories of the Roman Campagna, a more considerable essay in the Italian Villa
vein than anything carried out in England. But the asymmetrically towered Italian
Villa<a id="r142"></a><a href='#f142' class='c025'><sup>[142]</sup></a> did not mature in France in the way that it did in England, Germany, and the
United States. Séheult’s <i>Recueil</i> of 1821, of which a second edition appeared in 1847, is
one of the earliest and richest repositories of inspiration drawn from rustic Italian
building; but the edifices Séheult illustrated, however Picturesque in other ways, are all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>symmetrical and quite in the Durand tradition. J.-J. Lequeu (1758-<i>c.</i> 1824)<a id="r143"></a><a href='#f143' class='c025'><sup>[143]</sup></a> had produced
bolder projects a generation earlier. These are often asymmetrical, generally
quite wildly eclectic, and very vigorously plastic; but such things rarely, if ever, came
to execution in France except as garden fabricks. Lequeu had no success at all in his
later years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, the Rustic Cottage mode seems to have struck no real roots in France, even
though the painter Hubert Robert and the architect Richard Mique (1728-94), in designing
the fabricks of Marie Antoinette’s Hameau at the Petit Trianon in 1783-6, had
followed native rather than English rural models. Under the Restoration and the July
Monarchy inspiration came generally from English Cottage books. Visconti’s Château
de Lussy, S.-et-M., of 1844, though a fairly large structure, is really in the English Cottage
mode with an asymmetrically organized plan and an irregularly composed exterior.
This is almost unique and, in any case, quite undistinguished. A more vigorous flow of
rustic influence entered France via Alsace and directly from Switzerland. The Chalet aux
Loges of 1837 by Bonneau near Versailles was, as its name implies, a Swiss Chalet, but it
quite lacked the integrity of structural expression and the originality of plastic organization
of Eidlitz’s Willoughby house in Newport, R.I., which is, of course, considerably
later in date. Occasional imitations of the <i>style François I</i>, such as the already mentioned
country house by Canissié at Draveil, S.-et-O., have some irregularity both of outline
and of plan; but in general the <i>François I</i> of the July Monarchy, like so much of the
Jacobethan of Early Victorian England, is Picturesque only in detail, not in general
conception.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1840 the elder Bridant, who also built Chalets in the succeeding years around the
lake at Enghien, a watering-place on the outskirts of Paris, built a Gothic ‘Castel’ on the
plain of Passy, then a fairly open suburb. This was markedly asymmetrical and consistently
medieval in detail. The contemporary fame of this enlarged garden fabrick—for
such it really was—indicates its unique position in contemporary production, as unique
as Moffatt’s Gothic house in Park Lane in London. L.-M. Boltz, an architect of Alsatian
if not German origin but a pupil of Henri Labrouste, had some success with a less feudal
mode, half-timbered and asymmetrical, in the forties—a house of 1842 at Champeaux,
S.-et-M., was typical.</p>

<p class='c010'>This modest influx into France of Picturesque models from contemporary Germany
as well as from contemporary England might lead one to assume that the Picturesque, if
not the Gothic Revival, was more significant in Central Europe. In Germany and
Austria, however, as also in Scandinavia, Picturesque and medievalizing tendencies
mostly merged with Romantic Classicism in the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> rather than standing
apart, thus constituting neither an opposition eventually rising to triumph in the English
way, nor a mere gesture of aberrant protest as in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>Schinkel’s interest in Gothic has already been touched on, but none of his more ambitious
Gothic projects ever got beyond the drawing-board (see Chapter <a href='#ch02'>2</a>). There are
fewer such, in any case, belonging to his later than to his earlier years. Moreover, the
Gothic of the early projects naturally belongs to the contemporary High Romantic
world of Wyatt’s Fonthill Abbey and Latrobe’s alternative design for the Baltimore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Cathedral, not to the ethical and archaeological milieu of Pugin and the Camdenians.
Most of the virtues—by no means negligible—of his Berlin Werder Church of the
twenties are not Gothic virtues—not at any rate as Englishmen of the succeeding decades
understood them—they are rather Romantic Classical virtues. The principal interest
of his earlier Kreuzberg Memorial lies in its cast-iron material, a material anathema
to Pugin as a ‘modernistic’ innovation. The Babelsberg Schloss, based principally
on the modern castles that he saw on his visit to England in 1826, makes no pretensions
to archaeological correctness in the way of Pugin’s Alton Castle of about 1840 or Salvin’s
still later Peckforton.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few Castellated mansions of more local inspiration, such as Hohenschwangau in
Upper Bavaria, as reconstructed by J. D. Ohlmüller (1791-1839) in 1832-7, are closer
in spirit to Pugin’s and Salvin’s ideals. Hohenschwangau, like certain castles built in
this period on the Rhine, exploits the Picturesque possibilities of a fine site and the nostalgic
overtones of a district with a romantic medieval past. Schloss Berg in Bavaria,
which owes its present very domesticated Gothic character to the work done there by
Eduard Riedel (1813-85) in 1849-51, hardly deserves mention in this connexion any
more than do Schinkel’s more or less medievalizing country houses, so crisp and regular
is their design. Curiously enough, the vast Schloss at Schwerin, begun by G. A. Demmler
(1804-86) in 1844, is a more elaborate and extensive example of <i>François I</i> than anything
this period produced in France (Plate <a href='#pl057b'>57<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). It is also notably Picturesque, with
innumerable towers and gables disposed around the sides of an irregularly polygonal
court. Stüler carried this extraordinary pile to completion after Demmler left Schwerin
in 1851. Not very Picturesque, but representing another sort of medievalism, were two
Venetian Gothic houses Am Elbberg in Dresden, built with considerable archaeological
plausibility by an architect named Ehrhardt in the mid forties. They provide a curious
premonition of Ruskin and the High Victorian Gothic of England (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).
Semper’s Gothic Cholera Fountain of 1843 in Dresden has already been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'>As in France, much energy went at this time into the restoration and completion
of major medieval churches in Germany. Most notable in this connexion was the
work on Cologne Cathedral begun in 1824 by F. A. Ahlert (1788-1833), continued by
E. F. Zwirner (1802-61), and finally completed by Richard Voigtel (1829-1902) in 1880.
Assisting Zwirner, who had worked earlier under Schinkel on the Kolberg Town Hall,
was (among others) Friedrich von Schmidt (1825-91), after 1860 the most important
Gothic Revivalist in Austria (see Chapters <a href='#ch08'>8</a> and <a href='#ch11'>11</a>). No more than in France did this
activity in ‘productive archaeology’ in Germany lead to new building of much interest,
not at least until Schmidt began to work in Vienna.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ohlmüller’s Mariahilfkirche outside Munich, begun in 1831 and completed after his
death by Ziebland, the next considerable essay in ecclesiastical Gothic in Germany after
Schinkel’s Berlin church, is certainly much less appealing than is his mountain castle.
The hall-church form, authentically German though it was, produced a clumsily proportioned
mass, at the front of which a stubby tower ending in an openwork spire
seems to be ‘riding the roof’. This church is as ‘advanced’, in the sense of being fairly
plausible archaeologically, as Barthélémy’s Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours built a decade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>later, but that is about all one can say for it. It certainly does not stand up to comparison
with Rickman’s or Savage’s English churches of the twenties.</p>

<p class='c010'>De Chateauneuf’s Petrikirche in Hamburg begun in 1843, or at least its tower, has
already been mentioned (Plate <a href='#pl057a'>57<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). This is superior in design, and in some ways also
better built, to most of Pugin’s churches of this date. It is, for example, rib-vaulted
throughout in a quite plain but very competent way. The interior lacks, however, the
strikingly simple proportions and the warm colour of the red brick exterior; above all,
the complex spatial development of the transeptal members lacks clarity, although the
plan was probably taken over from the medieval Petrikirche that had been burned. The
Gothic churches of K. A. von Heideloff (1788-1865), beginning with his Catholic
church in Leipzig built in the Weststrasse there in 1845-7, are hardly above the level of
Ohlmüller’s and certainly much less successful than the Petrikirche, though Heideloff
had a much higher reputation than de Chateauneuf with contemporaries as a specialist
at Gothic on account of his published studies of medieval architecture.<a id="r144"></a><a href='#f144' class='c025'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In Berlin most of the new churches of this period by Stüler, Strack, and others were
in a Romanesquoid version of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. Of these elaborated and coarsened versions
of Schinkel’s suburban-church projects of a decade earlier, Stüler’s Jacobikirche of
1844-5 was basilican in plan; his Markuskirche, begun in 1848, was of the central type
but with a tall campanile rising at one side. The Berlin Petrikirche, built by Strack in
1846-50, was Gothic, however, and even clumsier than Ohlmüller’s much earlier
Mariahilfkirche, which it very closely resembles. Nor was Stüler’s one important essay
in Gothic, the Bartholomäuskirche, begun in 1854 and completed by Friedrich Adler
(1827-?) in 1858, much better. In general, the first half of the century was well over
before Gothic churches of any great size and pretension were built either in Germany
or Austria. The largest and most prominent, the Votivkirche in Vienna (Plate <a href='#pl099a'>99<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), for
the designing of which Heinrich von Ferstel (1828-83) won the competition in 1853
when he was only twenty-five, was not begun until 1856 nor completed until 1879
(see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In England the Picturesque and the Gothic Revival were effective solvents of Romantic
Classicism, because both, and particularly the latter, were consciously nationalistic,
emphasizing in an increasingly nationalistic period the recovery of local rather than of
universal building traditions. For a good part of their local acceptability they were dependent,
moreover, on certain warm connotations which their visual forms had for
English patrons. The Rustic Cottage, the Tudor Parsonage, the Castellated Mansion had
all, supposedly, been autochthonous products of the insular past. On the other hand,
even though the English of the eighteenth century had adopted as their own such
foreign painters as Claude and Poussin, from whose canvases the Italian Villa mode
principally derived both its forms and its prestige, that mode was certainly not English
in its ultimate prototypes. It is readily understandable, therefore,
that it was the Italian Villa, of all the established vehicles of the
Picturesque, which had the greatest success in a Germany romantically
mad about Italy. But such superb compositions as the Court Gardener’s
House by Schinkel (Plate <a href='#pl014a'>14<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) or Persius’s
Friedenskirche at Potsdam (Plate <a href='#pl015'>15</a>), perhaps the highest
international achievements in the Picturesque genre, owed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>only their basic concept, if even that, to England. Their elements were for the most part
borrowed directly from Italian sources, and they were carefully composed according to
a formal discipline not inconsonant with the standards of Romantic Classicism.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Swiss Chalet, an even more alien mode in England than the Italian Villa, was a
native one in Central Europe. Hence one finds Schinkel first, and then his pupils, exploiting
it with considerable virtuosity as the <i>Tirolerhäuschen</i>. Indeed, the particular form
of wooden fretwork which came to be called ‘gingerbread’ in English, one of the
favourite forms of later Picturesque detail everywhere in the western world from
Russia to America, is more likely to be derived from Alpine chalets via nineteenth-century
German than via nineteenth-century English intermediaries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Romantic Classicism, being founded on the basic Western European heritage of
Greece and Rome, could readily broaden its sources to include the Early Christian and
the Italian Renaissance. But to men of the early nineteenth century the Gothic was not a
universal European style as we are likely to consider it today; it was ‘Early English’ or
‘Altteutsch’ or (with far more justification) ‘l’architecture française’. The bigotry of the
English Gothic Revival was so intense in the forties that Scott was denounced in <i>The
Ecclesiologist</i> for even entering a competition for a church in Germany since, if successful,
his clients would be Lutherans not Anglicans. Such insular narrowness made the
Catholic Pugin’s Gothic paradoxically intransmissible to Catholic countries abroad,
quite as intransmissible in effect as the Jacobethan. Scott won his Hamburg competition
by modulating, to the horror of puristic compatriots, his usual fourteenth-century English
Decorated towards its German equivalent, on the whole a grander style as he
exploited it there.</p>

<p class='c010'>Continental nationalism, like Continental Neo-Catholicism outside France,<a id="r145"></a><a href='#f145' class='c025'><sup>[145]</sup></a> favoured
earlier—or later—modes than the Gothic, down at least to the mid century. The <i>Rundbogenstil</i>,
moreover, despite the fact that the precedent for its detail was quite as often
Italian as local, received warm support from nationalists in Germany; when exported,
moreover, as to the Scandinavian countries and the United States, it was properly recognized
as a German product (see Chapters <a href='#ch02'>2</a> and <a href='#ch05'>5</a>). In Latin countries, and particularly in
Italy, Gothic continued to seem alien; hence there are few examples of revived medieval
design of any sort there or in Spain and Portugal before 1850. Jappelli’s highly exceptional
work at Padua, mentioned earlier, is rich and delicate but not in the least plausible
to Northern eyes in the way of Ehrhardt’s somewhat similar Italian Gothic houses in
Dresden.</p>

<p class='c010'>A European consensus of taste had been achieved by the late seventeenth century,
despite the division of Europe into Catholic and Protestant countries, and this consensus
was maintained, and even grew in strength, for another hundred years and more. When
it finally broke down in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, it necessarily broke
down in different ways and to a different degree in each country. No new cultural synthesis
was achieved, at least as regards architecture, before our own day. The resultant
stylistic patchwork that the second half of the nineteenth century inherited was largely
the product of the increasing nationalism of the two decades that preceded the mid
century. This particularistic nationalism, rather than the concurrent increase in mere eclecticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of taste—for such eclecticism had existed to a greater or lesser degree since the
mid eighteenth century—explains the major difference in the architectural climate around
1850 from that around 1800; at least it is some part of the explanation. To be Roman in
architecture, to be Greek, even to be Italian, one need not cease to be English or French
or German. But to be Tudor one must be English, as to be <i>François I</i> one must be French,
or so it seemed to most architects and their clients in the forties.</p>

<p class='c010'>From this pattern of growing nationalistic divergence, this Late Romantic disintegration
of the cultural unity that had remained strong and vital through the first few
decades of the century, it is important now to turn to an aspect of architecture that derived
from a different international absolute, that of science and technology. The English
led in most technological developments affecting building methods from the mid
eighteenth century on, both in the introduction of new materials and in the exploitation
of new types of construction to serve new needs. But they led only because the Industrial
Revolution, at once the result of certain major technological changes and the cause of
innumerable others, had its origins and its early flowering in England. Before the first
half of the nineteenth century was over, other countries to which the Industrial Revolution
came relatively late were rapidly catching up. After the fifties technological leadership
in building passed from Britain to the United States and to the Continent. Some
consideration of the increased use of iron and glass between 1790 and 1855 may well
conclude the first part of this book.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Architectural</span> history has many aspects. Ideas and theories, points of view and programmes
can have real importance even when, as with the Picturesque and the earlier
stages of the Gothic Revival, most of the buildings which derive from them or follow
their prescriptions are lacking in individual distinction. Volume of production is also
significant; the disproportion between the previous chapter and the four that precede it
expresses fairly accurately the difference in the amount of building in the first half of the
century belonging, at least by a broad definition, to the rubric of Romantic Classicism
and the very much smaller amount—up to 1840 at least and outside England—that can
be considered essentially Picturesque or programmatically Neo-Gothic. But the history
of architecture must include the history of building as a craft or technic; sometimes the
story of technical development is—or has appeared to posterity to be—more important
than any other aspect of a particular historical development. Such has been the case until
quite lately with the rise of the Gothic in the twelfth century in France; it has also
seemed true in varying degree for the nineteenth century to many historians and critics.</p>
<p class='c010'>The Industrial Revolution induced a parallel but gradual revolution in building
methods; even today, after two hundred years, the potentialities of that revolution have
not been fully actualized. The technical story, particularly as it concerns the structural use
of ferrous metals, first cast iron,<a id="r146"></a><a href='#f146' class='c025'><sup>[146]</sup></a> next wrought iron, and then steel, begins well before
1800. There has already been occasion to mention, in passing, technical innovations in
various edifices where those innovations had a determinant effect on the total architectural
result. But it is worth while, partly for the intrinsic interest of the subject,
partly as preparation for subsequent technical developments of great importance later in
the nineteenth and in the twentieth century, to go back to the beginning and to recount
sequentially the episodes in the rise of iron as a prime building material, as also to touch
at least on the concurrent use of other ‘fireproof’ materials and the vastly increased exploitation
of glass. This sequence of episodes reaches a real culmination in the fifties with
the construction of a considerable number of ‘Crystal Palaces’, first in London and then
all over the western world, edifices that were almost entirely of iron and glass.</p>

<p class='c010'>A marked change in the situation came around 1855. For one thing, it was in that
year that Sir Henry Bessemer invented a new method of making steel in quantity so
that it could be profitably used for large building components. However, the full architectural
possibilities of the use of structural steel were hardly grasped before the nineties.
There was also in the fifties an increasingly general realization that unprotected iron was
not as fire-resistant<a id="r147"></a><a href='#f147' class='c025'><sup>[147]</sup></a> as had hitherto been fondly supposed. Then, too—and perhaps
most significantly—a sharp shift in taste at this time, leading to a predominant preference
for the massively plastic in architecture, made unfashionable both the delicate membering
suitable to iron and the smooth transparent surfaces provided by large areas of glass
(see Chapters <a href='#ch08'>8</a>-<a href='#ch11'>11</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The technical development of the use of ferrous metals in building continued unbroken
beyond the fifties; indeed, most of the quantitative records of the first half of the
century, in the way of distances spanned and volumes enclosed, were progressively exceeded
in the sixties, seventies, and eighties (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). From the point of view of
architecture, however, the story passes more or less out of sight for a generation. To a
certain extent metal literally ‘went underground’ as new types of foundations were
evolved for taller and heavier buildings; but more generally metal structure was masked
with stone or brick, as was first proposed in the forties in England, to provide protection
against the adverse effects of extreme heat in urban fires (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). When the
use of exposed metal and glass became significant again in the nineties that use was to
be a major constituent of general architectural development as it has
remained ever since (see Chapters <a href='#ch16'>16</a>, <a href='#ch22'>22</a>, <a href='#ch23'>23</a>, and
<a href='#ch25'>25</a>). But down to the 1850s the rise of iron and glass is best
considered as a separate story.</p>

<p class='c010'>This story is not confined to the most advanced countries. The tall, slim columns used
by Wren in 1706 to support the galleries in the old House of Commons <i>seem</i> to have
been of iron<a id="r148"></a><a href='#f148' class='c025'><sup>[148]</sup></a>; but short ones, introduced in 1752, can still be seen in the kitchen
of the Monastery of Alcobaça in Portugal, and a very early use of iron beams was
in the Marble Palace at Petersburg built by Antonio Rinaldi (1709-94) in 1768-72.
The main line of development, however, was undoubtedly English, French, and
American. Definitely dated 1770-2 were the iron members supporting the galleries
in St Anne’s, Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c010'>A much more notable and better publicized use of iron followed shortly after this
when metal replaced masonry for the entire central structure of the Coalbrookdale
Bridge in Shropshire. This was begun in 1777 by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard (?-1777)
with the active co-operation of Abraham Darby III, an important local ironmaster.<a id="r149"></a><a href='#f149' class='c025'><sup>[149]</sup></a>
Darby’s Coalbrookdale Foundry cast the iron elements that were needed and
the bridge was completed in 1779. Pritchard was an architect, and architects played a
more important part in the story of the early development of iron construction than is
generally realized. Soon, however, the importance of special problems of statics to
which such construction gave rise and, above all, the need to measure accurately the
strength of various components required the expert assistance of civil engineers, and
often the engineers came to build on their own without the collaboration of architects.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this point the story crosses the channel to France.<a id="r150"></a><a href='#f150' class='c025'><sup>[150]</sup></a> There Soufflot, the very technically
minded architect of the Paris Panthéon—one of the edifices with an account of
which this book began—assisted by his pupil Brébion, provided in 1779-81 an iron roof
over the stair-hall<a id="r151"></a><a href='#f151' class='c025'><sup>[151]</sup></a> that he built to lead up to the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. In the
next few years two rather obscure French architects, Ango and Eustache Saint-Fart
(1746-1822), were occupied, respectively, with the introduction of iron framing and of
‘flower-pot’ (i.e. hollow-tile) elements supported on timber framework to produce
more or less fireproof types of floors. Over the years 1786-90 the great French theatre
architect J.-V. Louis (1731-1800), horrified by the recurrent fires at the Palais Royal,
combined these two ideas when he designed the roof of the new Théâtre Français in
Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Now the main line of advance returns to England. In 1792-4 Soane avoided timber
altogether in the fireproof vaults of his Consols Office at the Bank of England, using
nothing but specially made earthenware pots; he also covered the twenty-foot oculus in
the central vault with a lantern of iron and glass (Plate <a href='#pl003'>3</a>). The architectural qualities of
this interior have already been stressed. Even more important for later architecture,
however, although effectively invisible, had been the adoption just before this of French
principles in a calico mill at Derby and the West Mill at Belper, both begun in 1792. These
were planned and carried out by the millowner-engineer William Strutt (1756-1830)
who used specially designed iron stanchions throughout carrying timber beams and,
in the top storey only, ‘flower-pot’ vaults between the beams such as Saint-Fart had
first introduced, but flat brick vaults or ‘jack-arches’ elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other mills soon followed. The first to have iron beams as well as stanchions seems to
be the Benyons, Marshall &amp; Bage flax spinning mill in St Michael’s Street, Shrewsbury.
This was built in 1796-7 from the designs of Charles Bage (1752-1822) a friend and
correspondent of Strutt. The much-publicized Salford Twist Company’s cotton mill at
Salford of 1799-1801, designed and built by Boulton &amp; Watt of steam-engine fame—they
knew Bage’s mill since they had installed his steam-engine—was according to
present evidence the second<a id="r152"></a><a href='#f152' class='c025'><sup>[152]</sup></a> to be erected with a complete internal skeleton of iron.
By 1800, then, a system of fire-resistant construction using cast-iron stanchions and
cast-iron beams, carrying what are sometimes called ‘jack-arches’ of brick, had been
established in the world of English mill-building. By 1850 such construction was in use
in Britain for almost all high-grade building. The system was significantly modified,
however, after about 1845 by the substitution of rolled—that is wrought—iron beams,
as proposed by Sir William Fairbairn (1789-1874),<a id="r153"></a><a href='#f153' class='c025'><sup>[153]</sup></a> since cast-iron ones had proved
dangerously brittle.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not necessary here to do more than sketch out the steps by which the new iron
skeleton structure became generally accepted. In 1802-11 James Wyatt introduced it in
the Castellated New Palace that he built at Kew for George III, an edifice of which little
is otherwise known since it was demolished in 1827-8. In line with this curious conjunction
of technical and stylistic innovation, already noted in Schinkel’s somewhat later
cast-iron Gothic monument of 1819-20 in Berlin, is Porden’s profuse use of iron for the
Gothic traceries and balustrades at Eaton Hall<a id="r154"></a><a href='#f154' class='c025'><sup>[154]</sup></a> in Cheshire in 1804-12, as also by
Hopper in the even more ornate Gothic Conservatory at Carlton House in London in
1811-12 (Plate <a href='#pl060b'>60<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Isolated columns of iron appeared in many edifices from the 1790s on. The most
notable extant examples, perhaps, are those in the kitchen and in several of the
rooms that were added by Nash to the Royal Pavilion at Brighton in
1818-21 (Plate <a href='#pl058a'>58<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
His ‘Chinese’ staircases of 1815-18 there are entirely of decorative pierced ironwork
and the framing of his big onion dome is also of metal, although of course invisible.
From the early use of iron columns for gallery supports in churches, increasingly
general by the early 1800s, there shortly developed the aspiration to exploit iron still more
extensively in such edifices. In three churches that Rickman and the ironmaster John
Cragg built in Liverpool, St George’s, Everton, and St Michael’s, Toxteth Road, both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>begun in 1813, and St Philip’s, Hardman Street, completed in 1816, the entire internal
structure is of iron. At St Michael’s the new material is not restricted to the interior
but appears on the outside as well. Rickman’s increasing archaeological erudition and
that of his contemporaries soon limited the use of iron in Gothic churches, however;
by Pugin and the Camdenians it was rigidly proscribed. Structural elements of iron in
churches of any architectural pretension became acceptable again only in the fifties (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Turning to what long remained the most notable field of metal construction, bridge
building,<a id="r155"></a><a href='#f155' class='c025'><sup>[155]</sup></a> one finds a rapid increase in the numbers and the spans of English metal
bridges from the mid 1790s on. In Shropshire, where the first iron bridge and the
first all-iron-framed  factory had been built, one of the greatest English engineers,
Thomas Telford (1757-1834),<a id="r156"></a><a href='#f156' class='c025'><sup>[156]</sup></a> built the Buildwas Bridge with a span of 130 feet in 1795-6. At the
same time the much longer and handsomer metal arch of the Sunderland Bridge in
County Durham was rising to the designs of Rowland Burdon. He was assisted, it
appears, by certain ideas supplied by Thomas Paine (1737-1809), better known for his
political writings than as a technician, who had had some association with bridge-building
in America. Burdon was a Member of Parliament and neither an architect nor
an engineer. Telford, however, though not professionally trained as an architect, had
worked for Sir William Chambers as a journeyman-mason on Somerset House in his
youth; throughout his career he built masonry toll-houses and even, on occasion, modest
churches in a competent if rudimentary Romantic Classical vein.</p>

<p class='c010'>In connexion with his work on the Bridgewater Canal and on the road system of the
Scottish Highlands, Telford designed and built innumerable bridges, the majority of
them of stone. But some of his later iron bridges, more skilfully devised technically and
more graceful visually than the Buildwas Bridge, deserve mention here. On the Waterloo
Bridge of 1815 at Bettws-y-Coed in Wales he used an openwork inscriptional band
and floral badges rather than architectural detail to give elegance and even richness to a
modest cast-iron arch. A longer and simpler bridge of similar design but unknown
authorship built in 1816 still spans the Liffey in Dublin.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same year as the Waterloo Bridge, at Craigellachie, amid austere Scottish mountains,
Telford bridged the Spey with a plain latticed iron arch. But it is worth noting
that he elaborated the masonry abutments as battlemented towers in a wholly Picturesque
way (Plate <a href='#pl059'>59</a>). For the Menai Bridge, built in 1819-24 between North Wales
and Anglesey, Telford used a new principle in metal construction, suspending his roadbed
from metal chains (Plate <a href='#pl058b'>58<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This was a principle of great antiquity already exploited
with success in America.<a id="r157"></a><a href='#f157' class='c025'><sup>[157]</sup></a> Telford’s masonry towers at the Menai Bridge are
of extremely elegant Romantic Classical design, tapered like Egyptian pylons and pierced
with delicate arches. In the twin bridge to this at Conway, also in North Wales, the close
proximity of the Edwardian castle led him to provide Castellated towers. In a still later
arched bridge at Tewkesbury of 1826 the latticed metalwork itself has the cuspings of
Gothic tracery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Menai Bridge remains the longest of its type in the British Isles. I. K. Brunel’s
Clifton Suspension Bridge near Bristol, for which he won the competition in 1829, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>which was begun only in 1837, has already been mentioned because of the Egyptian
detailing proposed for the piers. This bridge was finally completed only in 1864 by
W. H. Barlow (1812-92) using the materials of Brunel’s earlier Hungerford Suspension
Bridge in London. Of early arched metal bridges there are very many and by all the
leading English engineers of the first half of the century: John Rennie (1761-1821), I. K.
Brunel (1806-59), George Stephenson (1781-1848) and his son Robert (1803-59), as
well as Telford. The new railways, from the early thirties on, required even more
bridges than the canals constructed by the previous generation.</p>

<p class='c010'>In France Napoleon’s engineers built two arched iron bridges across the Seine. L.-A.
de Cessart (1719-1806) designed before 1800 and Delon in 1801-3 executed the Pont
des Arts, the first French bridge of iron, and Lamandé completed the Pont du Jardin du
Roi in 1806.<a id="r158"></a><a href='#f158' class='c025'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Neither is comparable in span or in logic of design to the earlier English
examples, thus reversing the pre-eminence which the French had held as bridge-builders
so long as masonry was used. The much later Pont du Carrousel in Paris, built by A.-R.
Polonceau (1788-1847) in 1834-6, was considerably superior to these Napoleonic
examples, though hardly epoch-making. But already in 1824, just as Telford’s Menai
Bridge was completed, Marc Séguin (1786-1875) was spanning the Rhône near Tournon
with a suspension bridge hung on wire ropes<a id="r159"></a><a href='#f159' class='c025'><sup>[159]</sup></a> instead of chains.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the early forties Séguin’s cable principle was developed much further in
America in bridges at Wheeling, W. Va., Pittsburgh, Penna., and Cincinnati, Ohio, by
the German immigrant John A. Roebling (1806-69). Those at Wheeling<a id="r160"></a><a href='#f160' class='c025'><sup>[160]</sup></a> and Cincinnati
are still in use. The more dramatically sited Niagara Falls Bridge of 1852, which
attracted world-wide attention when it was new, is no longer extant (Plate <a href='#pl060a'>60<span class='fss'>A</span></a>); its
success, however, led to Roebling’s being commissioned to build the famous Brooklyn
Bridge<a id="r161"></a><a href='#f161' class='c025'><sup>[161]</sup></a> in New York. Begun by him in 1869 and completed by his son Washington A.
Roebling (1837-1926) in 1883, this is still one of the principal sights of New York. It is
sad to record that work in the caissons sunk for the foundations of the piers killed the
designer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bridges are at the edge of the realm of architecture. Fairly early, moreover, they came
almost entirely under the control of men without architectural training or standards—Roebling,
for example, was such a one. Ordinary buildings, all of iron or with much use
of iron, are more significant as the century proceeds, both in France and in England.
Hopper’s Carlton House Conservatory (Plate <a href='#pl060b'>60<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) has been mentioned. In 1809 the
architect F.-J. Belanger (1744-1818), a pupil of Brongniart, replaced the domed wooden
roof of the Halle au Blé in Paris, added in 1782 by J.-G. Legrand (1743-1807) and J.
Molinos (1743-1831), with one of metal. The Marché de la Madeleine, designed by
M.-G. Veugny (1785-1850) possibly as early as 1824 but not built until 1835-8, was
apparently all of metal internally; its masonry exterior, however, was quite conventional.
Already in 1835, in the fish pavilion which formed part of his rather Durandesque
Hungerford Market in London, Charles Fowler had outstripped this in the direct
and elegant use of light metal components, here with no surrounding shell of masonry
at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some further Continental examples of the use of iron in the late twenties and thirties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>deserve mention at this point. Alavoine—at whose suggestion Duc’s Bastille Column,
begun in 1831, was made of metal, though the metal is bronze not iron—designed in
1823 a flèche 432 feet tall to rise over the crossing of Rouen Cathedral in the form of an
openwork cage of iron. Begun in 1827 and interrupted in 1848, this was finally completed
by the younger Barthélémy (Eugène, 1841-98) and L.-F. Desmarest (1814-?) in
1877. In 1829-31 Fontaine roofed the Galeried’Orléans, which he built across the
garden of the Palais Royal, with iron and glass. This structure, now destroyed, was more
prominent and also much wider than most of the many <i>passages</i> and <i>galeries</i><a id="r162"></a><a href='#f162' class='c025'><sup>[162]</sup></a> with glass
roofs that had been built in Paris and elsewhere in France from the 1770s on. The most
impressive extant French example is the Passage Pommeraye in Nantes, built by Durand-Gasselin
and J.-B. Buron (?-1881) in 1843; in this the circulation moves upwards
from one end to the other through three storey-levels. A modest Milanese example of
1831, the Galleria de Cristoforis by Andrea Pizzala (?-1862), might be mentioned
here also, as it was the local prototype for the greatest of all these characteristic nineteenth-century
urban features, Mengoni’s Galleria Vittorio Emanuele begun in the sixties
(Plate <a href='#pl075b'>75<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Of the many early nineteenth-century ones that remain in other European
cities, the Galerie Saint-Hubert in Brussels, built by J.-P. Cluysenaer (1811-80), a
pupil of Suys, in 1847, is one of the largest and best maintained. Warren’s Providence
Arcade in Providence, R.I., has been mentioned earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>Related to the <i>galeries</i>, and sometimes also so-called, were the large Parisian enterprises
of this period that were really early department stores. The Bazar de l’Industrie,
built by Paul Lelong (1799-1846) in 1830, had a large glass-roofed and iron-galleried
court of the sort that was to be continued in Parisian department stores down into the
present century (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). Even larger and bolder were the similar courts in the
department store known as the Galeries du Commerce et de l’Industrie, built by Grisart
and Froehlicher in the Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle in 1838, which has already been mentioned
for its richly arcaded Renaissance façades (Plate <a href='#pl062a'>62<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Shop-fronts of iron were
also frequent in Paris<a id="r163"></a><a href='#f163' class='c025'><sup>[163]</sup></a> by this time. Thus in France, as in England and America, the use
of iron was closely associated with structures for business use, but more usually with
sales emporia than with office buildings (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). Such, however, were not unknown
in England and America, though they were generally less extensive and made
less use of glass-roofed courts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Glass held in wooden frames had for some time been extensively employed for greenhouses.
How early iron began to be substituted for wood is not clear, and not perhaps of
much consequence.<a id="r164"></a><a href='#f164' class='c025'><sup>[164]</sup></a> Hopper’s ornately Gothic Conservatory of iron and glass at Carlton
House in London, demolished in the twenties, has been mentioned several times
already (Plate <a href='#pl060b'>60<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). In 1833, at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, Charles Rohault de
Fleury (1801-75) built a very large and handsome iron greenhouse without any
stylistic decoration. The structure of the square pavilions was as transparent and rectilinear
as the interior framework of Veugny’s slightly later market seems to have been,
and the ranges between were covered, just as so many wooden greenhouses had been,
with transparent roofs rising in two quadrants. At Chatsworth in Derbyshire the Great
Conservatory was built in 1836-40 by the 6th Duke of Devonshire’s gardener, Sir Joseph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Paxton (1803-65), possibly with some minor assistance from Decimus Burton. This
quite outclassed the largest earlier greenhouse, the Anthaeum at Brighton, designed in
1825 and built in 1832-3 for the horticulturist Henry Phillips, with a dome of iron and
glass 160 feet in diameter which collapsed before it was quite completed. The Chatsworth
conservatory was a still larger rectangle, 227 feet by 123 feet, with the exterior
rising in a double cusp like the side ranges of Rohault’s Paris greenhouse—or, for that
matter, like the section of the Anthaeum. The columns and beams here were of iron, but
the great arched principals of the ‘nave’ and the ‘aisles’ were of laminated wood and
four-foot long panes of glass were held in wooden sashes arranged in a ridge-and-furrow
pattern. A particular invention of Paxton’s, whose name was given to such roofs, was
the hollowing out of the wooden members at the base of the furrows to serve as gutters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Decimus Burton’s still extant Palm Stove at Kew, carried out by the contracting
engineer Richard Turner of Dublin in 1845-7, with rounded ends and a higher central
area, is more bubble-like than Paxton’s because of the absence of ridges and furrows on
its continuously glazed surface (Plate <a href='#pl067a'>67<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But both these great greenhouses were
among the most striking monuments of their Early Victorian day and were never exceeded
later in elegance though often in size. French rivals, long since destroyed, were
the Jardins d’Hiver in Lyons and Paris of 1841 and 1847 by Hector Horeau (1801-72),
the latter a rectangle 300 by 180 feet and 60 feet tall.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the thirties begins the story of a new building type, the railway station,<a id="r165"></a><a href='#f165' class='c025'><sup>[165]</sup></a> in
whose sheds the mid century was to realize some of the largest and finest examples ever
of ‘ferrovitreous’, or iron-and-glass, construction. The structures utilizing iron thus far
mentioned have been of two sorts, some, such as bridges, markets, greenhouses, etc.,
with only subsidiary masonry elements, if any at all; others, examples of mixed construction
with metal providing only the internal skeleton or the roof. Railway stations
were generally—and before the fifties always—examples of mixed construction, but of a
rather special sort. The iron and glass portions, that is the sheds, and the masonry portions
are likely to be merely juxtaposed, not truly integrated. Such a masonry frontispiece
as Hardwick’s Euston Arch in London of 1835-7 had no connexion at all with the
functional elements of the station behind—here by Robert Stephenson—although
Euston was an extreme case. But a happy co-ordination of the masonry and the iron-and-glass
portions of stations was rarely achieved anywhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the earliest railway station, that at Crown Street in Liverpool of 1830, nothing remains;
it was in any case a very modest structure.<a id="r166"></a><a href='#f166' class='c025'><sup>[166]</sup></a> Of its successors at Lime Street the
present station is the fourth on the site. Even the ‘Arch’ at Euston, the next major station
to be built, is now gone, despite the strenuous efforts of the Victorian Society and others
in Britain and overseas to save this symbolic portal to the Victorian Age. However, the
first station at Temple Meads in Bristol, which was built by Brunel in 1839-40, is physically
intact, though supplanted in present-day use by a larger and later one. Castellated
as regards the masonry block in front, the shed here is equally medievalizing; for its roof
is of timber, not of iron, and based on the fourteenth-century hammerbeam roof of
Westminster Hall in London, whose width it exceeds by a few feet only.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the once far finer Trijunct station at Derby, built in 1839-41, the last portions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Francis Thompson’s brick screen have finally been destroyed; the three original sheds provided
by Robert Stephenson, with Thompson’s collaboration on the detailing, were
each 56 feet wide in comparison to the 40-foot width of Stephenson’s earlier ones at
Euston (Plate <a href='#pl062b'>62<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The tie-beam roof had much of the graceful directness and linear
elegance of Rohault’s greenhouse or Veugny’s market.</p>

<p class='c010'>More and more, the use of iron was being generally accepted as a technical necessity
in the forties. At Buckingham Palace Blore, in adapting one of Nash’s side pavilions as a
chapel for Queen Victoria in 1842-3, used visible iron supports just as Nash had done so
long before in the interiors of the Brighton Pavilion for her uncle. Yet generally the use
of iron in important masonry structures in the thirties and the early forties was quite
invisible, being confined to the floors and the substructure of the roofs. In 1837-9 C.-J.
Baron (1783-1855) and Nicolas Martin (1809-?), for example, provided a complete
iron roof above the vaults of Chartres Cathedral, a work of very considerable scale and
technical elaboration that provided the immediate prototype for the iron roof of Gau’s
Sainte-Clotilde in Paris, designed in 1840 and begun in 1846. At the Houses of Parliament,
the actual construction of which started only in 1840, Barry capped the whole
with iron roofs—the external iron plates are actually visible, of course, but the fact of
their being of iron is rarely recognized. Fireproof floors built according to various
French and English patent systems were increasingly thought necessary in all high-grade
construction. Queen Victoria’s Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, constructed without
the aid of an architect by the builder Thomas Cubitt, had them throughout, as did
many other well-built country houses of the forties, at least in the passages and stair-halls.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here and there in the commercial buildings of this decade the iron skeleton used
inside came through to the exterior, as it had on one of Rickman’s Liverpool churches a
generation earlier. A small office building at No. 50 Watling Street in London, with
visible iron supports and lintels in the upper storeys but with brick corner piers and
brick spandrels, was a case in point, probably dating from early in the decade. By 1844
Fairbairn was recommending in a report that fireproof construction should be used in
all warehouses. Increasingly this was done in Lancashire and, before long, elsewhere;
Fairbairn himself had introduced it ten years earlier in the Jevons Warehouse on the
New Quay in Manchester.</p>

<p class='c010'>Closely associated with the development of iron construction is the development of
prefabrication; indeed, the parts of an elaborate iron edifice, such as a bridge or a greenhouse,
are necessarily prefabricated and merely assembled at the site. From the early
forties, and perhaps even before that, lighthouses were frequently erected in ironmasters’
yards in Britain, disassembled, shipped to Bermuda or the Barbadoes, and then reassembled.
In 1843 John Walker of London provided a prefabricated palace for an
African king and, by the end of the decade, prefabricated warehouses and dwellings of
iron were being supplied to gold-diggers in California and emigrants to Australia in
very considerable quantity. A look at the prefabricated houses of the 1940s will perhaps
explain why almost none of these ancestors of a century earlier seems to have survived,
at least in recognizable form. None the less, the advance of prefabrication remains a
notable technical—though hardly architectural—achievement of the 1840s and 1850s.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>To the mid and late forties belong several splendid examples of mixed construction in
various countries that not only represent technical feats of a high order but are also fully
architectural in character. Some are by architects, others by teams of architects and engineers
working in close collaboration. In building the Britannia Bridge,<a id="r167"></a><a href='#f167' class='c025'><sup>[167]</sup></a> which crosses
the Menai Strait near Telford’s Menai Bridge, the Derby Trijunct team of Stephenson
and Thompson in 1845-50 utilized with great success the rectangular tubes built up of
wrought-iron plates that Fairbairn, the consulting engineer, recommended (Plate <a href='#pl061'>61</a>).
The Holyhead railway line still passes through these tubes. The masonry entrances and
the tall towers, taller than they need have been because of Stephenson’s original intention
to use suspensory members for additional support to his rigid tubes, were superbly
detailed by Thompson. Contemporaries called them Egyptian, but the design has already
been noted as fully consonant with Romantic Classicism though quite devoid of
Grecian elements. At least the sculptor John Thomas’s pairs of gigantic lions at the
entrances are Nubian!</p>

<p class='c010'>At the London Coal Exchange<a id="r168"></a><a href='#f168' class='c025'><sup>[168]</sup></a> built in 1846-9 in Lower Thames Street, the City
Corporation’s architect Bunning arrived at no such complete co-ordination of masonry
and metallic design as did Stephenson and Thompson on the Britannia Bridge. The
masonry exterior consists of two <i>palazzo</i> blocks set at a fairly sharp angle to one another
and loosely linked by a very Picturesque round tower, free-standing in its upper stages.
Behind all this the dome of the interior court can barely be glimpsed. Inside this court,
however, no masonry at all is visible; one sees only an elegant cage of iron elements
rising to the glazed hemisphere above (Plate <a href='#pl063'>63</a>). The metal members are richly but
appropriately detailed, and there is even more appropriate decorative painting by Sang
in such panels as are not glazed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In France two monuments of comparable distinction have already been mentioned,
Henri Labrouste’s Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève of 1843-50 and Duquesney’s Gare de
l’Est of 1847-52 (Plate <a href='#pl022b'>22<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Unfortunately the original shed of the latter, with arched
principals of 100-foot span, was taken down when the station was doubled in size in the
present century. Inside the library a central row of iron columns of somewhat Pompeian
design—that is, resembling the slender, metallically scaled members seen in Pompeian
wall paintings—still carries the two barrel roofs on delicately scrolled arches of openwork
iron (Figure <a href='#i125'>14</a>). Since the masonry walls with their ranges of window arches are
visible all round, the effect produced is less novel than in the iron-and-glass court of
the Coal Exchange; but Labrouste achieved much greater integration between interior
and exterior (Plate <a href='#pl021'>21</a>). The Dianabad in Vienna, built by Karl Etzel in 1841-3, had a fine
iron roof; the circular bracing of the iron principals, a frequent motif in large openwork
members of cast iron at this time, was most appropriate to the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>
detailing of the masonry walls (Plate <a href='#pl066b'>66<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Monferran’s cast-iron dome on St Isaac’s in Petersburg, completed about 1842, has
already been mentioned (Plate <a href='#pl027a'>27<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). This was rivalled before very long by several
American examples,<a id="r169"></a><a href='#f169' class='c025'><sup>[169]</sup></a> most notably Walter’s enormous dome, built in 1855-65, above
the Capitol in Washington (Plate <a href='#pl082a'>82<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Baroque in silhouette and rather Baroque in detail
also, this may have encouraged—along with the rising taste for elaborately plastic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>effects of which it was itself a notable expression—the increasingly common practice of
casting the exposed iron elements of American commercial façades in the form of rich
Corinthian columns and heavily moulded arches.</p>

<p class='c010'>Around 1850 cast-iron architecture was coming to its climax everywhere. James
Bogardus (1800-74), a manufacturer of iron grinding machinery, not an architect or
engineer, began to erect in Center Street in New York in 1848 a four-storeyed urban
structure for his own use as a factory with an exterior consisting only of cast-iron piers
and lintels. This was one of the earliest<a id="r170"></a><a href='#f170' class='c025'><sup>[170]</sup></a> and most highly publicized of the cast-iron
fronts which Bogardus and various other ironmasters in New York and elsewhere made
ubiquitous in the principal American cities before and after the Civil War. But his
earliest completed iron front was that of the five-storey chemist shop of John Milhau at
183 Broadway erected within the year 1848. An extant work by Bogardus, the range of
four-storey stores built for Edward H. Laing at the north-west corner of Washington
and Murray Streets in New York, was begun in 1849 and finished within two months,
well before his own building was completed. These early cast-iron fronts are very
logical and expressive in the way the attenuated Grecian Doric columns and flat
entablatures are used to form an external frame; but the Laing stores have lost most of
the applied ornament that appealed so much to mid-century taste (Plate <a href='#pl067b'>67<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Later
façades are richer and heavier, generally with Renaissance or Baroque arcading, as has
just been noted. For the Harper’s Building in New York built in 1854, which incorporated
the first American rolled-iron beams, the architect John B. Corlies provided a design
of ornate Late Renaissance character. Curiously enough, in executing this building
Bogardus used for the upper four storeys the same castings as in the Sun Building that he
had erected in 1850-1 in Baltimore to the designs of R. G. Hatfield (1815-79). To the
typical cast-iron fronts of New York,<a id="r171"></a><a href='#f171' class='c025'><sup>[171]</sup></a> of which the most extensive and one of the simplest
was that of the old Stewart Department Store on Broadway begun in 1859 by
John W. Kellum (1807-71), vacated several years ago by Wanamakers and burned
during demolition in 1956, one may well prefer the delicacy of a Glasgow example, the
Jamaica Street Warehouse<a id="r172"></a><a href='#f172' class='c025'><sup>[172]</sup></a> of 1855-6, or a remote Far Western department store like
the Z.C.M.I. of 1868 in Salt Lake City, rivalling amid the Rocky Mountains those of
Paris. Neither of these is the work of architects.</p>

<p class='c010'>Great Britain and Europe saw few all-iron façades. This was in large part because the
danger of their collapse when exposed to the extreme heat of urban conflagrations, a
danger made real to Americans only by the fires of the seventies in Boston and Chicago,
was appreciated very early. Yet it was not in America but in Britain that the greatest
masterpieces of iron construction of the fifties were built. The succeeding turn of the
tide against the visible use of iron also had its origins in Britain, not in America where
the material had early become so tediously ubiquitous.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1850 Paxton was completing at Chatsworth a relatively small new greenhouse to
protect the <i>Victoria regia</i>, a giant water-lily imported from Africa by the Duke of
Devonshire. With its arcaded walls of iron and glass and its flat ridge-and-furrow roof,
this seemed to Paxton to provide a suitable paradigm for the vast structure<a id="r173"></a><a href='#f173' class='c025'><sup>[173]</sup></a> needed by
May 1851 to house the Great Exhibition, the first international exposition, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>scheduled to open at that time. The Commissioners of the Exhibition had held an international
competition that produced several extremely interesting ferrovitreous projects,
notably an Irish one by Turner, Burton’s collaborator at Kew, and a French one by
Hector Horeau. Rightly or wrongly, all of them were rejected, and the Commissioners’
own Building Committee, including the chief architectural and engineering
talents of the age, then produced a project of their own. Reputedly in large part the
work of the engineer Brunel and the architect T. L. Donaldson (1795-1885), this manifestly
impractical scheme, a sort of <i>Rundbogenstil</i> super-railway-station intended to be
built of brick—the project actually provided the inspiration for Herholdt’s Central
Station in Copenhagen of 1863-4, or so it would appear—was already out for bids
when Paxton presented in July 1850 his own scheme based on the Chatsworth Lily
House. Published in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> and offered with a low alternative bid
by the contractors Fox &amp; Henderson, this was accepted and—with much significant
modification—erected in the incredibly short space of nine months.</p>

<p class='c010'>Inside this vast structure, with its tall central nave, galleried aisles, and arched transept,
Paxton and his engineer associates, Sir Charles Fox (1810-74) and his partner Henderson
(to the two of whom a considerable part of the credit must go), created unwittingly
a new sort of architectural space. So large as in effect to be boundless, this space
was defined only by the three-dimensional grid of co-ordinates which the regularly
spaced iron stanchions and girders provided (Plate <a href='#pl064'>64</a>). These elements, designed for
mass-production, and also in such a way that they could be disassembled as readily as
they were assembled, had a new sort of mechanical elegance towards which the design
of metal components had hitherto been moving only very gradually. The character of
the casting process made it only too easy to impose on cast-iron elements all sorts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>more or less inappropriate decorative treatments from Gothic to Baroque; only rarely
had stylistic detail been successfully reinterpreted, as by Bunning in the Coal Exchange,
in terms of the fat arrises and broad radii that are suitable to the material and to the particular
method of its production. Even at the Crystal Palace a few touches of ornament
provided by Owen Jones (1806-89), who was also responsible for the highly original
and rather Turneresque colour treatment, suggest the gap—and, alas, it was in the 1850s
a widening gap—between the technicians’ and the architects’ ambitions for iron.</p>

<p class='c010'>Contemporaries had no words for what the Crystal Palace offered. Even today, when
the aesthetic possibilities of the new sort of space it contained as well as the technical advantages
of its method of assembly from mass-produced elements have been more generally
explored, it is not easy to describe Paxton’s and Fox &amp; Henderson’s achievement
despite the remarkably complete documentation that exists. The space inside the
tall transept (an afterthought designed to allow the saving of a great elm), arched on
laminated wooden principals, was more readily appreciated in its day than that in the
long nave, because it was more familiar. It is not surprising, therefore, that when the
Crystal Palace was disassembled and rebuilt in 1852-4 at Sydenham, where it lasted
down to its destruction—ironically by fire—in 1936, the entire nave was arched although
with principals of openwork metal rather than of laminated wood.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Crystal Palace’s structural vocabulary—though not, alas, the quality of its space—can
be appreciated in the Midland Station at Oxford, built by Fox &amp; Henderson with
identical elements in 1852. There one can still see how the new methods enforced a
modular regularity more rigid than that of Romantic Classicism and also encouraged a
tenuity of material quite unknown to the Neo-Gothic as executed in masonry. Thus the
visual result ran doubly counter to the rising fashions in architecture in the fifties
(see Chapters <a href='#ch09'>9</a> and <a href='#ch10'>10</a>). Within five years of the moment when the Crystal Palace was
greeted with such general—though never universal—acclaim the climactic moment of
the early Iron Age was already over. In those few years, however, Crystal Palaces rose
in many other major cities. The finest was perhaps that built in Dublin in 1852-4 by Sir
John Benson (1812-74) with its bubble-like rounded ends; the least successful that in
New York<a id="r174"></a><a href='#f174' class='c025'><sup>[174]</sup></a> of 1853 by G. J. B. Carstensen (1812-57), the founder of the Tivoli in
Copenhagen, and Charles Gildemeister (1820-69). The prompt destruction of this
last by fire was a fearful early warning of the limitations of iron construction unsheathed
by masonry. The burning of Voit’s Glaspalast of 1854 in Munich, like that of
the Sydenham Palace, occurred in our own day, as also the similar end of the Paleis
voor Volksvlijt in Amsterdam, which was built by Cornelis Outshoorn (1810-75)
in 1856.</p>

<p class='c010'>The prestige of iron construction was never higher than in the early fifties. For Balmoral
Castle, not yet rebuilt in its final form, the Prince Consort ordered in 1851 a prefabricated
iron ballroom by E. T. Bellhouse of Manchester modelled on the houses for
emigrants to Australia by Bellhouse that the Prince had seen at the Great Exhibition. In
the Record Office in London, begun by Pennethorne in this same year, even more iron
was used for the internal grid of separate storerooms and for the window-sash than in
the great mill that Lockwood &amp; Mawson built for Sir Titus Salt at Saltaire in Yorkshire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>in 1854. The internal structure of this last represented another major contribution by
Fairbairn. Characteristically, however, the detailing of the external masonry of the Record
Office is more or less Tudor, if rather crude and over-scaled, while that of the
Saltaire mill is picturesquely Italianate.</p>

<p class='c010'>In two new London railway stations, both happily extant, these years produced the
chief rivals to the Crystal Palace. At King’s Cross, planned by the architect Lewis Cubitt
in 1850 and built in 1851-2, the two great arched sheds somewhat resembled technically
the transept of the original Crystal Palace, their principals having been of laminated
wood. These had eventually to be replaced in 1869-70 with the present steel principals
which are, however, still held by Cubitt’s original cast-iron shoes. The masonry block
of the station on the left, or departure, side is undistinguished but fairly inconspicuous.
The great glory of the station is the front, with its two enormous stock-brick arches that
close the ends of the sheds towards the Euston Road (Plate <a href='#pl066a'>66<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The idea had been
Duquesney’s at the Gare de l’Est, but here there is no irrelevant Renaissance detail, only
grand scale and clear expression of the arched spaces behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Paddington Station, built in 1852-4, has no such grand exterior, being masked at the
southern end by the Hardwicks’ Great Western Hotel. The engineer Brunel here called
in the architect M. D. Wyatt (1820-77) as collaborator, and for the metal members
of the shed Wyatt devised ornamentation which—as Brunel specifically requested—is
both novel and suited to the materials (Plate <a href='#pl065'>65</a>). There is a slightly Saracenic
flavour both to the stalagmitic modelling of the great stanchions and to the wrought
elements of tracery that fill the lunettes at the ends and even run along the sides of
the great elliptically-arched principals. But the detailing of these, if unnecessarily
elaborate, is certainly quite original and not inappropriate to the materials or to the
complex spatial effects of the three great parallel sheds crossed by two equally tall
transepts. The cool spirit of Cubitt’s station recalls that of earlier Romantic Classicism;
the richer forms of Paddington are related to the rising ‘High’ styles of the third quarter
of the century, of whose initiation the Great Western Hotel was one of the earliest indications
(see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>By 1853 the craze for iron construction was so great that the Ecclesiological Society,
forgetting their Puginian principles—Pugin had died the previous year, but not before
issuing a severe critique of the metal-and-glass construction of the Crystal Palace—commissioned
their favourite and most ‘correct’ architect, Carpenter, to design for them an
iron church. It was not Carpenter’s death two years later but the refusal of the English
bishops to consecrate prefabricated structures for permanent use that brought to nothing
this interesting project along the lines of Rickman’s and Cragg’s Liverpool churches of
forty years earlier. The general flood of prefabrication, now producing all sorts of structures
for the Antipodes and other remote areas that still lacked their own building industries,
slowed down in 1854, when the demands of the War Office for barracks (on
account of the Crimean War) deflected prefabricators from civil production.</p>

<p class='c010'>In that year, however, Sydney Smirke began one of the last major monuments of cast
iron in England, the domed Reading Room in the court of his brother’s British Museum.
Awkward in proportion and encased in stacks, this is not to be compared in distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of design with the Reading Room that Henri Labrouste added to the Bibliothèque
Nationale in Paris in 1862-8<a id="r175"></a><a href='#f175' class='c025'><sup>[175]</sup></a> (Plate <a href='#pl069'>69</a>). That superb interior, with its many light
domes of terracotta carried on the slenderest of metal columns and arches, is a great advance
over his earlier Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève (Figure <a href='#i125'>14</a>). The Reading Room
in Paris has no proper exterior, however, any more than does that in London, for it is
incorporated in a group of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century structures that Labrouste
adapted and enlarged (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>). Even more striking are Labrouste’s stacks, visible
from the Reading Room through a great glass wall, for in them the entire spatial
volume is articulated by vertical and horizontal metal elements in a fashion somewhat
like the interior of the Crystal Palace. But in the sixties such things were exceptional.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1853-8 L.-P. Baltard’s son Victor (1805-74) built the Central Markets<a id="r176"></a><a href='#f176' class='c025'><sup>[176]</sup></a> of Paris
with the assistance of F.-E. Callet (1791-1854) in a mode much less elegant but still
franker, exposing his metal structure outside as well as in, at Napoleon III’s personal
insistence. Saint-Eugène, an almost completely iron-built church of Gothic design, was
erected in Paris in 1854-5 by L.-A. Boileau (1812-96).<a id="r177"></a><a href='#f177' class='c025'><sup>[177]</sup></a> Boileau’s Saint-Paul at Montluçon,
Allier, completed in 1863, is a second French example of a cast-iron church, and
he made designs for several others. His Notre-Dame-de-France off Leicester Square in
London, a modest church of 1868, has been completely rebuilt since the last war.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, to house the first Paris international exhibition, that of 1855, F.-A. Cendrier
(1803-92) and J.-M.-V. Viel (1796-1863), both pupils of Vaudoyer and Lebas, provided
in 1853-4 not another Crystal Palace, such as Dublin, New York, Copenhagen, Munich,
Amsterdam, and Breslau, among other cities, had built or were building, but an example
of mixed construction. The great iron-and-glass arched interiors were all but completely
masked externally by a very conventional masonry shell. It was not until the Paris Exposition
of 1878 that iron and glass were frankly exposed and decoratively treated on the
exterior of such a structure in France (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). The curve of enthusiasm for iron
was evidently taking a downward dip; in Britain the Age of Cast Iron came to an end
even more suddenly and much more dramatically than in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1855 Sir Henry Cole, the prime mover of the Great Exhibition of 1851, had to
provide on the estate at Brompton, in the part of London now called South Kensington
that the Commissioners had just acquired from the proceeds of the Exhibition, temporary
housing for the collections that were being formed by the Government’s Department
of Practical Art. Having to build in great haste and in war-time, it is perhaps not
surprising that Cole employed, properly speaking, neither an architect nor an engineer,
but allowed the Edinburgh contracting firm of C. D. Young &amp; Son to design as well
as erect the structure subject to some nominal control from the engineer Sir William
Cubitt (1785-1861). It was certainly a surprising product of a Government agency devoted
to raising the standard of ‘art-manufactures’! Although we can today appreciate
some of the practical virtues of this edifice as a Museum of Science and Art, it must be
admitted that it was inferior even to the general contemporary run of prefabricated
structures to which it belongs technically. Derisively christened the ‘Brompton Boilers’
by George Godwin (1815-88), editor of the <i>Builder</i>, it roused a chorus of disapproval as
loud if not as widespread as the Crystal Palace had done of approval five years before.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>After this time British and Continental interest in iron construction waned rapidly;
for fifteen years or so exposed iron was chiefly exploited in the commercial façades of the
United States, themselves now more and more masonry-like in scale and in detailing, as
has been noted. Structural steel began to be used here and there from the early sixties,
but the serious beginnings of the Age of Steel lay a quarter of a century ahead
(see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>At least in England, its principal home, the Age of Cast Iron, so
paradoxically interrelated with the Gothic Revival in its very early
stages, came to an end in considerable part because of the triumph of
the Gothic Revival around 1850 (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>). For several
decades the characteristic new architectural developments were
stylistic rather than technical. Yet it was the later theories—not the
practice—of a French medievalist, Viollet-le-Duc, which played a great
part in the renewed interest in the frank use of metal on the
Continent in the eighties and nineties (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Many</span> historians, in despair, have merely labelled the period
after 1850 ‘Eclectic’ as if earlier periods of architecture—and
notably all the preceding hundred years since 1750—had not also been
eclectic, although admittedly to a lesser degree. Within the
eclecticism of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
there can readily be distinguished the two major stylistic divisions
with which Part I has dealt separately (in Chapters <a href='#ch01'>1</a>-<a href='#ch05'>5</a> and in Chapter
<a href='#ch06'>6</a>, respectively). So also in the fifties, sixties, and seventies two
principal camps are discernible among the architects. Their programmes
were less clear than in the previous half century, and in one case
much less widely accepted internationally. Yet the High Victorian
Gothic of England, taken together with the later Neo-Gothic elsewhere,
on the one hand, and what may be loosely called the international
Second Empire mode on the other, subsume between them a fair part of
the more conspicuous architectural production of the third quarter of
the century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both the Victorian Gothic of this period and the
Second Empire mode were ‘high’ phases of style. Perhaps for that
reason neither of them controlled, in the way that Romantic Classicism
had done in the earlier decades of the century, all or even any very
extensive segments of building activity; yet between them they gave
colour to a very considerable proportion of it. The obvious stigmata
of one or of the other, or even of both—external polychromy and high
mansard roofs, respectively—are to be found on such modest things as
mills and working-class housing blocks as well as on major public
monuments. The High Victorian Gothic first developed in Anglican
ecclesiastical architecture and always carried with it a rather
churchy flavour—sometimes quite ludicrously, as in the case of Gothic
distilleries, Gothic public-houses, and Gothic sewage plants.
Continental Neo-Gothic was more largely confined to churches,
especially in France. The international Second Empire mode found its
inspiration in the grandiose extension of a palace in Paris; something
of the Parisian and even the palatial clung to it when it was used—as
often in the non-French world—for such things as factories and modest
suburban villas.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both the Victorian Gothic and the Second Empire had definite national
homes, yet both were also full of elements of Italian origin. In that
respect the High Victorian phase of the fifties and sixties was
somewhat analogous to the Germanic <i>Rundbogenstil</i>, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>well as being the direct heir of the earlier and more puristic Gothic
Revival of the forties in England. Often the Second Empire mode was
even more Italianate, since it was in the main but a pompous
modulation of the earlier Renaissance Revival. The one had its roots
in the Picturesque, but it differed from earlier Picturesque
manifestations in being a ‘style’—or very nearly such—not merely the
reflection of a point of view. The other had roots not only in
Romantic Classicism but also farther back in the High Renaissance and
the Baroque; some qualities of those earlier styles were both
continued and revived. But neither High Victorian Gothic nor Second
Empire were ‘revivals’ in the sense of those of the first half of the
century; they lived with a vigorous nineteenth-century life of their
own, not one borrowed from the past. In both cases one may more
properly say that they <i>had</i> revived.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Second Empire mode was the heir, or at least the successor, of the
last universal style of the western world, the Romantic Classical.
Moreover its wide international sway was hardly terminated by the end
of Napoleon III’s reign in France any more than its beginning had
waited for his enthronement. Concerning that sway it should be noted,
however, that considered as a definite ‘style’ the Second Empire mode
is very far from characterizing as much of French production in this
age as of that in several other countries. Indeed, somewhat
paradoxically, its actual initiation may almost be said to have
occurred outside France and before the political Second Empire
actually began in 1852. In this chapter and the next, certain
alternative developments in succession to the earlier Renaissance
Revival have been associated with the Second Empire mode, sometimes a
bit arbitrarily perhaps, for lack of a more appropriate place to deal
with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although France was less affected by the Picturesque in the first half
of the nineteenth century than England, the Renaissance Revival had
permitted some straying from the more rigid paths of Romantic
Classicism in the thirties and forties (see Chapters 3 and 6). The
earliest French work of the twenties that may seem of Italian
Renaissance inspiration is very severe and flat, approximating
occasionally the effects of the German <i>Rundbogenstil</i> yet
consistently disdaining that mode’s tendencies towards either
medievalism or originality in detail. Gradually, under Louis Philippe,
there were changes: on the one hand, there arose an interest in later
periods of the Italian Renaissance; on the other, there came an
increasing and less peripheral use of sixteenth-century and even later
native models. Common to both these developments was an evident desire
for richer and more plastic effects.<a id="r178"></a><a href='#f178' class='c025'><sup>[178]</sup></a> What above all distinguishes
the mature Second Empire mode, even more in other countries than in
France, is the elaboration of three-dimensional composition by the
employment of visible mansard roofs and of pavilions at the ends and
centres of buildings, these last capped either with especially tall
straight-sided mansards or, even more characteristically, with convex
or concave ones. Such features are rare before 1850 in France and
almost unknown elsewhere.<a id="r179"></a><a href='#f179' class='c025'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The return of the mansard in France is harder to document than its
appearance as a new element of architectural composition in other
countries, for in France it had never passed out of use as a practical
device for providing usable attics. With the increasing emulation of
sixteenth-century French models in the second quarter of the century
tall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>roofs of a more medieval sort began to be used with some frequency.
Biet’s ‘Maison de François I’ of 1825 did not have them; but ten years
later they are very prominent on the <i>François I</i> house Dusillion
built in the Rue Vaneau. Moreover, Lesueur in the late thirties could
hardly avoid their use when extending the sixteenth-century Hôtel de
Ville (Plate <a href='#pl022a'>22<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). As noted earlier, it seems to
have been H.-A.-G. de Gisors, at the École Normale Supérieure built in
1841-7, who first re-introduced on a prominent building mansards of
seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century character, and in association
with detailing that suggests, vaguely at least, the <i>style Louis
XIV</i>. By the late forties the use of such mansards was fairly
common in France, although they rarely received much emphasis.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had Dusillion in 1849-51 built the mansarded mansion for T. H. Hope<a id="r180"></a><a href='#f180' class='c025'><sup>[180]</sup></a>
in Paris rather than in London therefore, or the Danish-born but
Paris-schooled Detlef Lienau (1818-87)<a id="r181"></a><a href='#f181' class='c025'><sup>[181]</sup></a> his mansarded Hart M. Shiff
house of the same date in France rather than in America, neither would
have been especially notable. But in the England and the United States
of the mid century emulation of French models was in itself novel.
Dusillion’s and Lienau’s mansards, moderate enough by French
standards, suggested to the English and the Americans a way by which
edifices of generically Renaissance character could be given something
of the bold silhouette that high pointed roofs provided for Victorian
Gothic structures. Like Barry’s loggia-topped towers and his corner
chimneys, mansards appealed directly to the mid century’s
characteristic desire to break sharply away from the flat-surfaced,
and nearly flat-topped, cubic blocks of Romantic Classicism. Pavilion
composition offered a similar resource for the plastic modelling of
façades.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1851, following immediately after the Hope house, came the
designing of the Great Western Hotel at Paddington in London by the
Hardwicks. This was still, one should note, before the Second Empire
actually began in France. Gawky though this hotel is, and very
uncertain in its use of French precedent, contemporaries generally
recognized its inspiration as derived from the period of Louis XIV.
The complex massing and the broken skyline, with roofs of different
heights and pavilion-like towers at the ends, are much more obviously
a premonition of the Second Empire mode in the form the world outside
France would shortly adopt it than were the London and New York houses
of two years earlier. Unlike Dusillion and Lienau, moreover, the
architects of the Great Western Hotel, recognized masters of the dying
Greek Revival as well as of the rising Gothic and Renaissance
Revivals, were not French-trained.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the international Second Empire mode had thus, in a sense,
beginnings outside France, it is nevertheless true that its spiritual
headquarters was in Paris. The prestige of the new Emperor’s capital,
a prestige rapidly regained after more than a generation of desuetude,
quite as much as the visual appeal of multiple mansards and pavilioned
façades, explains the world-wide success of the mode during, and even
well after, the eighteen years that the Second Empire lasted.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in 1852 that Napoleon, then Prince-President, made himself
Emperor. He had already signalized, a few months earlier, his ambition
to revive the splendours not alone of his uncle’s rule but those of
earlier French monarchs by his decision to complete the Louvre<a id="r182"></a><a href='#f182' class='c025'><sup>[182]</sup></a>—or
more accurately to connect the Louvre with the Tuileries. This was a
project
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>over which generations of architects had struggled on paper and at
which several abortive starts had already been made. Visconti received
the commission, not Duban, who had been engaged since 1848 on what was
proving a highly controversial restoration of the old Louvre. Visconti
was chosen not for his reputation as a private architect but largely
because a succession of public projects for new library buildings in
Paris that he had been asked to prepare under Louis Philippe and even
under the Second Republic had all fallen through, and it was felt he
deserved an important commission from the State. Perhaps also his Tomb
of Napoleon I at the Invalides made him especially sympathetic to
Napoleon III.</p>

<p class='c010'>A viable scheme for the New Louvre was produced by the sixty-year-old
Visconti with very great rapidity. Counting on the great size of the
Cour du Carrousel to obscure the awkward lack of parallelism between
the Louvre and the Tuileries, he planned two hollow blocks extending
westward at either end of the existing western front of the old
Louvre. Beyond these blocks narrower wings, in part built already,
would connect with the two ends of the Tuileries Palace in which
French rulers usually lived. In the middle of the court fronts of the
side blocks there were to be large pavilions, echoing Le Mercier’s in
the centre of the west wing of the old Louvre, and other smaller
pavilions to mark the salient corners towards the Place du Carrousel.
Although the new constructions were intended to house various
things—two ministries, a library, stables for the Tuileries, etc.—they
were designed comprehensively with no specific indication of what
would go on behind the long walls and inside the various pavilions.
The New Louvre was not a palace or Royal residence; but like the old
Louvre, which by this time housed several disparate activities—most
notably the chief art gallery of France—it was meant to be
representationally palatial.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1853 Visconti died and H.-M. Lefuel (1810-80), a pupil of Huyot,
took over. Lefuel very much enriched the design and thereby provided
the prime Parisian exemplar of the Second Empire mode, at least as the
world outside France came to know it in the late fifties and sixties.
Heavily though Lefuel leaned on the precedents provided by the various
sections of the old Louvre, it is important to stress that his design
did not represent, in the way of the first half of the century, a
specific ‘revival’. For one thing, the old Louvre, begun by Pierre
Lescot late in François I’s reign and carried forward by a succession
of architects in the next four hundred years, offered a wide range of
suggestions but no one consistent model. The most characteristic and
striking features of the New Louvre, the corner pavilions, were those
that were most eclectic in inspiration and in their total effect most
nearly original (Plate <a href='#pl068'>68</a>). No part of the old Louvre is as
boldly plastic as these pavilions with their rich applied orders set
far forward of the wall-plane; only Le Mercier’s Pavillon de l’Horloge
on the old Louvre offered precedent for the great height of all the
new pavilion roofs and in particular for the convex mansards, like
square domes, over the central pavilions flanking the Cour du
Carrousel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sumptuous as was Goujon’s sculptural investiture of the earliest work
in the court of the old Louvre, this was delicate in scale and very
flat; much of the sculptural decoration of the new pavilions follows
Goujon fairly closely, but even more—some of it nearly in the round—is
so bombastically plastic as almost to justify the term ‘Neo-Baroque’.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Although there is actual early-seventeenth-century precedent for most
of their individual details, the very lush stone dormers set against
the high straight mansards of the corner pavilions are particularly
novel in effect. For the next thirty years, and even longer, such
features of the New Louvre would be imitated all over the western
world yet, paradoxically, they had much less influence in France and
almost none in Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>As far as the outside world—particularly perhaps England and the
United States, but hardly less Latin America—was concerned the New
Louvre was the prime architectural glory of Second Empire Paris and
the symbol, <i>par excellence</i>, of cosmopolitan modernity. Burghers
in Amsterdam and Montreal, vacationers in Yorkshire and silver-miners
in the Rocky Mountains all expected to find echoes of it in the
sumptuous new hotels they frequented; Latin Americans continued to
emulate it even into the twentieth century. Yet in the real Paris of
the Second Empire, the Paris which is largely still extant today, the
New Louvre is but one prominent structure among many and, as has been
said, not even a very typical one.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first Napoleon had had no time to carry out any considerable
urbanistic reorganization of his French capital. But for the goodwill
of his successors, notably Louis Philippe, the architectural projects
that he was able to initiate would never have been brought to
completion. His nephew, however, vowed to peace and not to war, had
nearly two decades in which to build. Well before his reign began,
moreover, he had definitely made up his mind to replan Paris more
drastically than any great city had ever been replanned before.<a id="r183"></a><a href='#f183' class='c025'><sup>[183]</sup></a>
Only a few fine squares, the Champs Élysées, and the Rue de Rivoli
remain in Paris from earlier campaigns of urban extension and
replanning; but the Paris of the Second Empire, the Paris of the
boulevards and the great avenues, is the urbanistic masterwork of the
third quarter of the nineteenth century, a period notably deficient in
urbanistic achievement almost everywhere else except in Vienna.</p>

<p class='c010'>For all the sumptuousness of the individual monuments with which the
focal points of Napoleon III’s Paris were ornamented, their settings
are generally more distinguished than the ‘jewels’ mounted in them; an
exception, of course, is the Place de l’Étoile where, however, the
jewel was inherited from an earlier period (Plate <a href='#pl007'>7</a>). This is
because of the high standard of design that was maintained in the
general run of new blocks of flats that lined the <i>places</i>, the
boulevards, and the avenues (Plate <a href='#pl075a'>75<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Since in
Second Empire Paris the urban totality is more significant than the
individual buildings, and since over the years of the Empire—or for
that matter down even to the eighties—there was very little stylistic
development, the Parisian production of this period may well be
presented more topographically than chronologically, as if one were
outlining a tour<a id="r184"></a><a href='#f184' class='c025'><sup>[184]</sup></a> of its splendours.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one extant railway station of some distinction belonging to the period at which
to arrive. Yet this station, Hittorff’s Gare du Nord designed in 1861 and built in 1862-5,
is perhaps less advanced than Duquesney’s Gare de l’Est, which was just being completed
as the Second Empire opened (Plate <a href='#pl022b'>22<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The flat Ionic pilasters of the façade and
the great archivolt-surrounded openings between them are evidence of the firm resistance
that Hittorff’s generation put up against the lusher tastes of the mid century as expressed
in Lefuel’s work on the New Louvre. Even more characteristically Romantic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Classical, and probably finer though less famous than the Gare du Nord, was Cendrier’s
Gare de Lyon, since demolished, which had been built almost a decade earlier at the same
time as his Palais de l’Industrie in the early fifties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Proceeding from Hittorff’s station one strikes immediately the characteristic broad
straight streets, often lined with trees, that were the new Second Empire arteries of Paris.
The continuous ranges of grey stone buildings, their even skyline crowned with inconspicuous
mansards, generally include shops below and always contain flats above.
They are so designed as to attract very little attention to the individual structures,<a id="r185"></a><a href='#f185' class='c025'><sup>[185]</sup></a>
almost as little as do the separate houses in London terraces. There is much less irregularity
of outline than along Nash’s Regent Street, for example, and a general consistency
in the size and phrasing of the windows. There is also very little noticeable variety in the
handling of the conventional apparatus of academic detail so crisply carved in fine limestone.
Even where, by great exception, some bolder architect such as Viollet-le-Duc
used more original detail, the unity of character is barely disturbed, so consistent are the
basic patterns of the façades (Plate <a href='#pl101a'>101<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the plan of Paris has remained basically radial, the visitor has the choice of
proceeding circumferentially along one of the lines of outer or inner boulevards or of
turning inwards to the centre. It is more profitable, on the whole, to advance centripetally,
for the outer boulevards are generally very monotonous. The Île de la Cité was
the original core of Paris; the east-and-west axis of the Louvre, extended westward
along the Champs Élysées all the way to the Étoile, already provided a central tract
parallel to the Seine; the new cross axis was to be a north and south artery running from
the Gare de l’Est to the Observatoire. On the Île the vast complex of the Palais de
Justice, whose restoration and extension had been undertaken by Duc as early as 1840,
received a notable Second Empire ornament in its western block, facing the Place
d’Harcourt, which was built by Duc assisted by E.-T. Dommey (1801-72) in 1857-68.
Rationalistic in its structural expression and Classical in most of its detailing,
this façade and the hall behind it reflect the tastes of the period in the heavy scale of
the parts and the rather cranky—and certainly studied—awkwardness of the modelling
of the various conventional elements of the orders and minor features of detail. Duc’s
earlier work at the Palais de Justice, on the other hand, was detailed with very great
grace and elegance, it may be noted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The principal Second Empire construction on the east-and-west axis of Paris, the
New Louvre, has been described already. Along the north side of the Louvre the Rue de
Rivoli was extended eastward in 1851-5 the entire length of the palace with no change in
the original Percier and Fontaine design except for the addition of high quadrantal mansards
throughout the entire length of the street and its subsidiaries. Even a large new
hotel<a id="r186"></a><a href='#f186' class='c025'><sup>[186]</sup></a> was forced into this framework. Yet because of its island site, the high rounded
roofs give this block as it is usually seen from the Place du Théâtre Français to the north
something of the new plasticity; it thus provided eventually an appropriate terminus to
the Avenue de l’Opéra, after that was finally completed under the Third Republic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Facing the east side of the Louvre, Hittorff balanced the restored Gothic front of
Saint-Germain-l’Auxerrois with the new front of the Mairie du Louvre built in 1857-1861.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Characteristic of this period in France is the avoidance of Gothic detail on this secular
façade in favour of something vaguely <i>François I</i>; yet the pattern of the front
of the church is carefully repeated, even to the rose-window in the high-pitched gable,
and the new tower by Ballu, on axis between the Church and the Mairie, is Gothic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Up to the Rond Point, the Champs Élysées is flanked by parked areas on either side
and decorated by fountains and other features designed by Hittorff (see Chapter <a href='#ch03'>3</a>). At
the Rond Point there are a few very sumptuous <i>hôtels particuliers</i>, but beyond that the
avenue was built up—or more accurately, for the most part, would eventually be built
up—like a very broad boulevard flanked by large blocks of flats with shops and cafés
below. In the open area on the left between the main axis, the river, and the new quarter
which had taken its name ‘François I’ from Biet’s house, lay the Jardin d’Hiver of 1847
and the Palais de l’Industrie of 1853-4. Here also is the Rotonde des Panoramas of 1857
by G.-J.-A. Davioud (1823-81). Around the Arc de l’Étoile, at the far end of the
Champs Élysées, are ranged pairs of dignified houses; these were designed by Hittorff
with the collaboration of Rohault de Fleury in 1855 and executed in 1857-8 in a
mode so academic as to be almost a revival of the <i>style Louis XVI</i> (Plate <a href='#pl007'>7</a>). The general
layout of the <i>place</i> was determined by Haussmann, expanding a much earlier scheme of
Hittorff’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>What is most notable in all this mid-nineteenth-century construction along the main
axis of the city is the continuity of taste between the Second Empire period and the
period that preceded it. The only real echo of the New Louvre was in the big private
houses set back from the Rond Point.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Avenue de l’Opéra, extending north-westward from the Place du Théâtre
Français, has become, since its completion in 1878, the major cross axis, rather than the
earlier Boulevard Sébastopol to the east. The Place de l’Opéra, with a short spur of the
avenue at its south end, was laid out in 1858; and the façades of the buildings (Plate <a href='#pl070c'>70<span class='fss'>C</span></a>)
around it began to go up in 1860 from the designs of Rohault de Fleury<a id="r187"></a><a href='#f187' class='c025'><sup>[187]</sup></a> and Henri
Blondel (1832-97). The Opéra<a id="r188"></a><a href='#f188' class='c025'><sup>[188]</sup></a> (more properly Académie Nationale de Musique)—after
the New Louvre the most conspicuous product of the Second Empire—was begun in
1861 from the design with which J.-L.-C. Garnier (1825-98), a pupil of Lebas who also
worked briefly for Viollet-le-Duc, won the second competition held in that year. Although
the Garnier design is often thought to be particularly characteristic of the taste
of the Imperial couple, it was actually very unpopular with the Empress Eugénie; she
had expected the project of her friend Viollet-le-Duc to be accepted and was furious
when it failed to win. Substantially completed externally by 1870, the Opéra was not
finally finished and opened until January 1875, so that neither Napoleon III nor Eugénie
ever entered it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here, at its heart, the contrast between setting and monument in Second Empire
Paris is at its most extreme, even though this setting is far richer and more plastic
than that provided by the severely flat houses that surround the Arc de l’Étoile. Just as
there, however, the use of a giant order on all the big blocks that form the <i>place</i> reveals
the distinctly academic taste of the leading French architects in this period; but Blondel’s
rounded pavilions, where two major streets come in on either side at an angle, provide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>an almost Baroque elaboration in the grouping of the various masses by which the
complex space is defined (Plate <a href='#pl070c'>70<span class='fss'>C</span></a>). Certainly the result is very different from the large
open areas surrounded by discrete blocks of plain geometrical shape favoured by
Romantic Classicism.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Opéra is sumptuous in a rather different way from the New Louvre (Plate <a href='#pl070b'>70<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
Yet in Garnier’s work, as in Lefuel’s, a generically Neo-Baroque effect is achieved with
elements mostly High Renaissance in origin, but here Italian rather than French. The
richly coloured marbles, the admirably placed sculpture by Carpeaux, and above all the
fashion in which the masses pile up—from the ornate colonnade crowning the main
façade, through the half-dome which expresses the auditorium externally, to the tall
stage-house at the rear—is much richer plastically than the somewhat repetitive scheme
of the New Louvre. The whole, moreover, is made fully three-dimensional by the
comparable organization of the major elements at the sides and on the rear. Thus Garnier
provided a visual equivalent to the complex ordering of his extremely elaborate
plan, a plan the undoubted virtues of which can be fully appreciated only on paper
(Figure <a href='#i139'>15</a>). Inside the Opéra the great staircase, the foyer, and the actual auditorium
drip with somewhat brassy gold and the profusion of detail has a curiously un-Renaissance
spikiness and lumpiness (Plate <a href='#pl071'>71</a>). This quality underlines how un-archaeological
was Garnier’s approach, how responsive he was (perhaps unconsciously) to the new
tastes of the mid century that had produced the High Victorian<a id="r189"></a><a href='#f189' class='c025'><sup>[189]</sup></a> Gothic in England in
the previous decade and fostered generally the international success of the Second Empire
mode. When Eugénie asked him what the ‘style’ of the Opéra was—<i>Louis XIV</i>, <i>Louis
XV</i>, <i>Louis XVI</i>—he replied with both tact and accuracy: ‘C’est du Napoléon III’.</p>

<p class='c010'>Like the lushness of the New Louvre, Garnier’s lushness has an undeniably parvenu
quality characteristic of the time and place; but the pace he set, however much emulated
all over the world in later opera houses, and the peculiar capacity he showed for satisfying
the taste for bombastic luxury of the third quarter of the century were never equalled
by other architects, least of all by French ones. In the twin theatres flanking the Place
du Châtelet,<a id="r190"></a><a href='#f190' class='c025'><sup>[190]</sup></a> which were built in 1860-2, Davioud, the architect of the Rotonde des
Panoramas, made little attempt to vie with Garnier’s Opéra; but they are considerably
more successful in their own right than is the Vaudeville in the Boulevard des Capucines
of 1872 by A.-J. Magne (1816-85), which does. Garnier’s own Panorama Français of
1882 at 251 Rue Saint-Honoré has only a modest façade to the street.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only one other work of Garnier himself rivals the Opéra, his Casino at Monte Carlo
of 1878. The fine site that this occupies somewhat makes up for its tawdry finish in
painted stucco, and the two-towered façade towards the bay has a properly festive
air. The Casino and Baths he built at Vittel in 1882, his Observatory at Nice, and the
Cercle de la Librairie of 1880 in the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris are considerably
quieter in design. The Palais Longchamps<a id="r191"></a><a href='#f191' class='c025'><sup>[191]</sup></a> of 1862-9 in Marseilles by H.-J. Espérandieu
(1829-74), who had worked for Questel and for Vaudoyer, two palatial museum
blocks joined by a curved colonnade above an elaborate cascade, is more Neo-Baroque
than most work of the period (Plate <a href='#pl070a'>70<span class='fss'>A</span></a>); but much of the credit should go to
the sculptor Bartholdi whose earlier fountain project Espérandieu took over.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Despite what has been said of the houses at the Rond Point, most Second Empire
mansions in Paris, at least those built by leading architects, tend to be rather restrained
in their general design and often quite archaeologically correct in their detailing.
They are likely, moreover, to follow French seventeenth- or eighteenth-century
models rather than those of sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Italy. Already, in the
Hôtel de Pontalba, Visconti had copied Versailles closely in the interiors, while his exterior
followed the line of the early eighteenth-century <i>hôtels particuliers</i>. (This was drastically
remodelled in the eighties.) Labrouste, in the Hôtel Fould, 29-31 Rue de Berri, which
was built in 1856-8, was rather plausibly Louis XIII; while Alfred Armand (1805-88),
a pupil of Leclerc and a frequent collaborator with Pellechet, in designing the Hôtel
Pereire and its twin in the Place Pereire about 1855 approached the <i>style Louis XVI</i> as
closely as Hittorff did round the Étoile. Nevertheless, study of Parisian exemplars inspired
many foreign architects to design houses that could hardly be anything else but Second
Empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is largely explained by the special character of the publications<a id="r192"></a><a href='#f192' class='c025'><sup>[192]</sup></a> of C.-D. Daly
(1811-93), a pupil of Duban, and of P.-V. Calliat (1801-81), a pupil of Vaudoyer, through
which current French work of this period chiefly became known to the outside world.
Almost as was the case at the opening of the century, when the volumes illustrating Prix de
Rome projects made the higher aspirations of French architects better known to students
abroad than their ordinary practice, the publications of this later day seem to have
focused attention on certain aspects only of the French architectural scene, aspects prominent
enough, but not altogether characteristic as regards public monuments and
dominant official taste. Without knowledge of the French architectural past, without
the inhibitions instilled early in French architects by their training at the École des
Beaux-Arts, foreign architects readily derived from published sources a Second Empire
mode considerably lusher than was generally approved for public use in French academic
circles and made it very much their own. Even in public architecture foreigners must
have seen current work with different eyes from the French.</p>

<p class='c010'>For example, the Tribunal de Commerce on the Île de la Cité, an agency provided in
1858-64 with a building of its own instead of mere quarters in the Bourse, was supposed
by French contemporaries to express in its detailing the Emperor’s personal enthusiasm
for the <i>quattrocento</i> buildings that he had lately seen in Brescia. But posterity, like
foreigners when the Tribunal was new, notes in this work of A.-N. Bailly (1810-92) the
characteristic Second Empire mansards and the almost Neo-Baroque dome—which at
Haussmann’s insistence was added to close the vista down the new north-south artery—not
the uncharacteristically flat and delicately detailed façades. Far finer is the front of
that section of the École des Beaux-Arts facing the Seine which was built by Bailly’s
master Duban in 1860-2, finer and doubtless also truer to the most exigent taste of the
day. Rather directly expressive of its interior uses—it houses exhibition galleries, etc.—the
detailing of this façade is quite original without being at all cranky like Duc’s on the
Palais de Justice, and the whole very subtle in composition (Plate <a href='#pl072b'>72<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Much of the cold
severity characteristic of the previous half-century remains; but Duban was clearly trying
to be creative, not archaeological, so that one cannot properly apply stylistic names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>from the past, not even to the extent that it is possible to do so in the case of the New
Louvre and the Opéra. However, such high distinction of design as Duban achieved
here was rather rare in Second Empire Paris; it parallels in this period the equally exceptional
distinction of Henri Labrouste’s Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève of the forties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The accepted range of stylistic inspiration was so wide that it is often only a certain
syncretism that gives buildings of this period, nominally in any one of half a dozen
‘styles’, a recognizably contemporary flavour. So also new methods of construction,
rather than superseding masonry in toto and thereby demanding original expression as
in Victor Baltard’s Central Markets, were more characteristically fused with it, as in the
reading-rooms of Labrouste’s libraries. Of these only the later, that in the Bibliothèque
Nationale, was built under the Second Empire (Plate <a href='#pl069'>69</a>). Except for this Salle de Travail
of 1861-9 and the Magasin or stacks, both so exciting to posterity, most of Labrouste’s
other work at this institution, begun in 1855, is as derivative as his private houses; for the
most part it is actually hard to say where the old seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
buildings stop and his nineteenth-century additions and those of his successor J.-L. Pascal
(1837-1920) begin.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the increasing use of metal in all sorts of buildings, there was undoubtedly less
sympathy for it than earlier, and hence less success in finding appropriate expression of
its qualities (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>). By exception, however, the Central Markets in Lyons of
1858 by Antoine Desjardins (1814-82), a pupil of Duban, have a somewhat Labrouste-like
elegance in the arched and pierced metal principals spanning the three naves that is
not found in Baltard’s so much larger Central Markets in Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>In church architecture something like full eclecticism reigned in Paris under Napoleon
III, although Gothic was most popular in the provinces. The new Parisian churches
generally occupy focal points where major avenues join or boulevards change direction;
but, like the Opéra, they have little visual relation to the sober settings provided by the
blocks of flats among which they are placed. Instead, each one seems intended to illustrate
an alternative mode quite different from the standard urban vernacular of the day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Saint-François-Xavier in the Boulevard Montparnasse was begun by the elderly
Lusson in 1861 and finished by T.-F.-J. Uchard (1809-91) in 1875. With its basilican
plan and cold Early Renaissance detail, this might well have been built under Louis
Philippe. Saint-Jean-de-Belleville by Lassus, on the other hand, begun in 1854 and completed
in 1859 after his death, while larger and rather better built than his churches of
the forties, hardly represents any advance over Gau’s Sainte-Clotilde, completed by
Ballu only two years earlier. Neo-Gothic could hardly be duller. However, Saint-Denys-de-l’Estrée
(Plate <a href='#pl098'>98</a>), the parish church of the suburb of St-Denis, designed by
Lassus’s associate and successor Viollet-le-Duc<a id="r193"></a><a href='#f193' class='c025'><sup>[193]</sup></a> in 1860 and built in 1864-7, is more
comparable in quality to the contemporary High Victorian Gothic churches of England
(see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Victor Baltard’s church of Saint-Augustin, also of 1860-7, is not located, like the
Gothic edifices by Lassus and Viollet-le-Duc, in a working-class district or suburb, but
occupies a very prominent if awkwardly narrow triangular site in the Boulevard Malesherbes
near its intersection with the Boulevard Haussmann. Considering the success of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>his Central Markets, it is not surprising that Baltard used iron here; but he did so with
much less consistency and thoroughness than Boileau had done at Saint-Eugène (see
Chapter 7). The arched iron principals of the roof accord very ill with the Romanesquoid-Renaissance
design of the masonry structure below. The front, with its
great rose window, is somewhat more effective. At least it provides a strong urbanistic
focus among the standardized ranges of blocks of flats that line the boulevards in this
quarter. Two other big Parisian churches are similar in quality although quite different
in appearance. Ballu, in addition to finishing Sainte-Clotilde, built both Saint-Ambroise
in the Boulevard Voltaire, which is certainly more plausibly Romanesque than Saint-Augustin,
and also La Trinité in the Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin, which is much less
plausibly <i>François I</i> than his later work at the Hôtel de Ville. La Trinité was built in
1861-7, Saint-Ambroise in 1863-9. Both are vast and pretentious, but neither has much
positive character. Like so many comparable examples of the eclecticism of this period
in other countries, it is by their faults and not by any characteristic virtues that they are
readily recognizable as products of the Second Empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two Romanesquoid churches less prominently located, and hence less well known, are
considerably more interesting. One is the parish church of Charenton, Seine, built by
Claude Naissant (1801-79) in 1857-9; this is clearly composed and detailed with a somewhat
eclectic elegance not unworthy of Labrouste or Duban. Much larger is Notre-Dame-de-la-Croix
in the Rue Julien-Lacroix in the Menilmontant quarter of Paris. Built
by L.-J.-A. Héret (1821-99), a pupil of Lebas, in 1862-80, this is a cruciform edifice with
the vaulting ribs all of openwork iron like those of Saint-Augustin. For archaeological
plausibility it compares not unfavourably with Questel’s church at Nîmes, begun some
twenty years earlier, in the design of the masonry portions of the structure.</p>

<p class='c010'>The only big Paris church of the sixties of much real distinction—the only French
church, for that matter—is Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge at the intersection of the Avenue
du Maine and the Avenue d’Orléans. This was built by J.-A.-E. Vaudremer (1829-1914),
a pupil of Blouet and Gilbert, in 1864-70. Romanesque and Early Christian—perhaps more
specifically Syrian—in inspiration,<a id="r194"></a><a href='#f194' class='c025'><sup>[194]</sup></a> this basilica is notably direct in its structural expression,
nobly scaled, expressively composed, and restrained almost to the point of crudity
in its detailing (Plate <a href='#pl072a'>72<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Vaudremer’s Santé Prison off the Boulevard Arago in Paris,
which was commissioned in 1862 and built in 1865-85, is also Romanesquoid or at least
in a sort of very simple <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. The still quite Durandesque character of this prison
illustrates Vaudremer’s close linkage, through the work of his two masters, who had both
specialized in designing prisons and asylums under Louis Philippe, with the classicizing
rationalism of 1800. His much later Lycées of the eighties, Buffon and Molière in Paris
and those at Grenoble and Montauban, on the other hand, reflect the more Gothic
rationalism of Viollet-le-Duc (see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Vaudremer’s work may have had some influence, around 1870, on the American
Richardson, who was still a student in Paris when Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge was begun
(see Chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>). However, no significant line of development led forward in France
from his sort of church design. In a smaller and later Parisian church, Notre-Dame
in the Rue d’Auteuil of 1876-83, Vaudremer himself showed no further development of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>his personal style, though the interior here is not unimpressive in its scale and proportions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The vast and prominent church of the Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre in Paris was begun
by Paul Abadie<a id="r195"></a><a href='#f195' class='c025'><sup>[195]</sup></a> (1812-84), a pupil of Leclerc, well after the Second Empire was over
in 1874, and largely finished before the end of the century by the younger Magne
(Lucien, 1849-1916). This is Romanesque in inspiration, too, but painfully archaeological—’painfully’,
because its architect, in carrying out the restoration of his principal
medieval exemplar, Saint-Front at Périgueux, seems to have sought to provide ‘precedent’
for several of the features that he introduced here! Yet the bold exploitation of
the remarkable site of this church, dominating Paris from the heights of Montmartre,
and the bubble-like silhouette of its cluster of domes when seen from a distance give
the Sacré-Cœur positive qualities lacking in most other French ecclesiastical work of the
later nineteenth century except Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Architecture in France had been a highly centralized profession ever since the late
seventeenth century. Under Louis XV a few provincial cities showed some capacity for
independent activity, but this subsided during the unproductive years that followed the
Revolution. Except to a certain extent in Lyons and Marseilles, local activity did not
revive very notably in the first half of the nineteenth century. Under the Second Empire
most French cities still remained content to follow the lead of Paris. There is hardly a
large provincial town which did not—to stress first the positive side of the picture—lay
out broad boulevards or straight avenues and line them with more or less successful
versions of the <i>maisons de rapport</i> of Paris; on the negative side, the public buildings
and churches were usually derived from, and too often very inferior to, prominent
Parisian models.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the centres of the biggest cities one can well believe that one has not left Paris.
Occasionally, however, there are urbanistic entities which have more vitality than the
rigidly controlled and tastefully restrained new squares and streets of the capital. The
fairly modest square in front of the cathedral at Nantes, with its ranges of high-mansarded
blocks, is a case in point. Better known is the rising slope of the Cannebière, continued
in the Rue de Noailles and the Allées de Meilhan at Marseilles, with the columnar dignity
of the Chamber of Commerce on the left near the Vieux Port at the bottom and
the paired Gothic towers of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul closing the vista at the top. Public
buildings in smaller cities sometimes have a rather illiterate sort of gusto in their boldly
plastic massing and exuberantly coarse detailing closer to Second Empire work abroad
than to that of Paris; to some eyes these have a theatrical charm not unlike the period
flavour of Offenbach’s operas. They often date from well after 1870.</p>

<p class='c010'>Espérandieu’s Neo-Baroque Palais Longchamps at Marseilles has been mentioned
(Plate <a href='#pl070a'>70<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Also at Marseilles is the enormous Romanesco-Byzantine cathedral of 1852-93,
which was designed by the younger Vaudoyer (Léon, 1803-72), a pupil of his father
and also of Lebas. Espérandieu became <i>inspecteur</i> on the job in 1858 and carried on the
work after Vaudoyer’s death. This is hardly superior to Ballu’s Paris churches, much
less to Vaudremer’s or even Abadie’s, but it is more striking plastically in its rather
redundant combination of domed west towers, crossing dome, and transeptal domes;
it is also exceptionally colouristic for France. There is an almost High Victorian Gothic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>brashness in the treatment of the exterior walls with bands of alternately white and green
stone. Here the aggressive assurance of the period speaks with an even louder voice than
at the New Louvre and the Paris Opéra; this assurance is echoed, moreover, near by in
Espérandieu’s own high-placed church of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde of 1854-64, a
scenic accent of the most brazen Second Empire vulgarity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Marseilles Exchange, however, dominating its own tree-lined square, is rather
similar to the Chamber of Commerce in the Cannebière as it rises among ranges of
houses that are more Provençal than Parisian in the modesty of their painted stucco
fronts. Originally begun in 1842 by Penchaud, the Exchange was largely built in 1852-60
by his pupil Coste, but its style remains <i>Louis Philippe</i> rather than Second Empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great elaboration and consequent expensiveness of Second Empire modes of design,
as generally executed in France in fine freestone, restricted their full exploitation to
the capital and the largest provincial cities. There is a sort of economic striation, from
the immense sums the Emperor and, after him, the authorities of the Third Republic—even
though relatively impoverished—were willing to put into representational public
construction at the top, through the level represented by what Parisian investors spent
on blocks of flats or rich provincial cities on their principal monuments, down finally to
the niggardly building budgets of small towns and villages. This striation provides a sort
of analogue to the breakdown of that earlier stylistic unity which had been so marked
and happy a characteristic of French architecture for at least a century and a half. That
this breakdown was still relative in France is apparent when one turns to other countries
where eclectic taste in this period was bolder and where the variation in expenditure
on different sorts of buildings was at least as great.</p>

<p class='c010'>French architectural prestige revived internationally in the fifties to remain surprisingly
high for another two generations.<a id="r196"></a><a href='#f196' class='c025'><sup>[196]</sup></a> However, the Second Empire mode was
gradually succeeded internationally by another Parisian mode to which it is convenient
to apply the name ‘Beaux-Arts’, from the École des Beaux-Arts out of whose instruction
it stemmed. More and more foreigners went to Paris to study as the second half of
the century wore on, until Paris became almost what Rome had been in the eighteenth
century. In architectural education the influence of the École was especially strong in the
New World; the training of English and most Continental architects was much less
affected. The first two architectural schools to be founded in the United States, both by
William Robert Ware (1832-1915)—himself, curiously enough, a practitioner of a
fairly aggressive sort of Victorian Gothic (see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>)—that at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in Boston opened in 1865 and the somewhat later school at Columbia
University in New York, were both based on the methods of the École.<a id="r197"></a><a href='#f197' class='c025'><sup>[197]</sup></a> French
winners of the Prix de Rome were increasingly imported to serve as teachers, and three
generations later the last of them had not yet left the United States. The influence of
the École in Latin America was even more powerful, and the dominance of its ideas
has lasted in some countries down almost to the present.<a id="r198"></a><a href='#f198' class='c025'><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Both in the New World and the Old most cities grew like weeds in the third quarter
of the century; the analogy is, indeed, a rather accurate one, for the growth was characteristically
rank, uncontrolled, and destructive of earlier architectural amenities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Various European capitals, however, imitating Napoleon III’s re-organization of Paris,
took advantage of the clearing away of their fortifications to lay out something equivalent
to the <i>grands boulevards</i>. Florence during the late sixties, for example, when it was
very briefly the capital of Italy, saw the laying out, according to the general plan of
Giuseppe Poggi (1811-1901), of a range of avenues and squares that extend around the
city to the east, north, and west on the site of the old walls. These districts, built up over
the years 1865-77, display little or none of the new Second Empire afflatus. For the
most part everywhere in Italy in this period the architecture is of generically Renaissance
revival character. Only in the much later Piazza della Repubblica, carved out of
the slummy heart of the city in the 80s and 90s, is there a heavy pomposity of scale that
is curiously un-Florentine—the centre of nineteenth-century Athens might be Neo-Greek,
but it was Munich, not Florence, that became characteristically Neo-Tuscan!</p>

<p class='c010'>In the old Savoy capital of Turin, where the first half of the century had seen such
notable urbanistic projects, a vigorous local tradition continued to control most of the
new work.<a id="r199"></a><a href='#f199' class='c025'><sup>[199]</sup></a> However, at the farther side of the Piazza Carlo Felice the Porta Nuova
Railway Station was built in 1866-8, as was mentioned in Chapter 3, by the engineer
Mazzuchetti and the architect Ceppi in a rather original sort of <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. The
vast iron and glass lunette at the front still provides a handsome termination to the
long axis of the Via Roma, although the rear of the station has been rebuilt since the
War. Along the Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II the earlier arcades of Promis were continued
almost indefinitely; but the detailing of the façades grew continually richer in
evident emulation of Second Empire Paris. This influence also affected the building up
of the contiguous quarter of the city. In the fine new square at the end of the Via Garibaldi,
however, balancing the earlier Piazza Vittorio Veneto at the end of the Via Po,
the Piazza dello Statuto opened in 1864, the façades by Giuseppe Bollati (1819-69) are
not at all Parisian, but recall rather the local Academic Baroque of Juvarra. Especially
effective, and rare in Turin, are the warm and tawny colours of the painted stucco walls
here.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the uniting of Italy and the eventual taking over of Rome as the capital of the
kingdom of Italy on the downfall of Napoleon III in 1870, a tremendous expansion<a id="r200"></a><a href='#f200' class='c025'><sup>[200]</sup></a>
of the old Papal city began. The two principal new streets extending eastward, the Via
Venti Settembre and the Via Nazionale, were laid out in 1871 and built up over the next
fifteen years. Vast and tawny-coloured like the Piazza dello Statuto in Turin, but much
less distinguished in design, is the Finance Ministry in the former street built by Raffaele
Canevari (1825-1900) in 1870-7. Equally grand in scale and much more dignified are
the quadrantal façades of the Esedra built by Gaetano Koch (1849-1910) in 1885 at the
head of the Via Nazionale facing Michelangelo’s Santa Maria degli Angeli (Plate <a href='#pl076a'>76<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
With the fine later fountain by A. Guerrieri and Mario Rubelli in the centre this provides
a most impressive piece of late-nineteenth-century academic urbanism. It still offers a
not altogether unworthy preface to the Baths of Diocletian—of which it actually occupies
the site of the largest exedra—and to the new railway station (Plate <a href='#pl183b'>183<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), both
so near, which epitomize between them the ancient and the modern worlds in the architecture
of Rome.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Koch’s Palazzo Boncampagni in the Via Vittorio Veneto, now the American Embassy,
built in 1886-90, is also very dignified. It represents very well the occasional tendency
in that decade towards restraint and sobriety in Renaissance design, a tendency that
balances the contemporary stylistic development towards the Neo-Baroque. In the Via
Nazionale the two most prominent edifices<a id="r201"></a><a href='#f201' class='c025'><sup>[201]</sup></a> by Italian architects, the Palazzo delle
Belle Arti of Pio Piacentini (1846-1928) begun in 1882 and Koch’s Banca d’Italia of
1889-1904, are both quite academic in a respectable Renaissance way, and in the latter
case impressively monumental as well. The same applies <i>a fortiori</i> to the two principal
public edifices begun in Rome in the eighties—not the respectability, goodness knows,
but the monumentality. The enormous Palazzo di Giustizia, in a new quarter across the
Tiber, is an incredibly brash example of Neo-Baroque loaded down with heavy rustication,
doubtless of Piranesian inspiration. This was designed by Giuseppe Calderini (1837-1916)
in 1883-7 and built in 1888-1910 without the intended high mansards.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the most overpowering new structure in Rome, dominating the whole city and
blocking the view of both the ancient Forum and the Renaissance Campidoglio, is
the Monument to Victor Emmanuel II, rising above the much enlarged Piazza Venezia
at the head of the Corso. Largely the work of Count Giuseppe Sacconi (1854-1905),<a id="r202"></a><a href='#f202' class='c025'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
who in 1884 won the third competition held for its design, this was begun in 1885 and
continued after his death by Koch, Piacentini, and M. Manfredi (1859-1927), being
finally brought to completion only in 1911 by the engineer R. Raffaelli. Hardly
Second Empire nor yet quite ‘Beaux-Arts’, this most pretentious of all nineteenth-century
monuments well illustrates the total decadence of inherited standards of Classicism
in Europe towards the end of the century. It can be compared only with Poelaert’s
Palace of Justice in Brussels, begun twenty years earlier, and entirely to the latter’s advantage
even as regards mere gargantuan assurance.</p>

<p class='c010'>In general, Italian production of the second half of the century is of relatively slight
interest; moreover, it often seriously upsets the balance of earlier urban entities by its
heavy scale. The great exception, and the one ranking Italian work of the period, is
generally recognized to be the Galleria Vittorio Emmanuele II in Milan. In Genoa, behind
the theatre, the Galleria Mazzini of 1871 also exceeds in length, in height, and in
elaboration all the galleries and passages built in various European cities in the first half
of the nineteenth century, yet it is not essentially very different from them in its scale
or its detailing. The vast cruciform Galleria in Milan, however, extending from the
Piazza del Duomo to the Piazza della Scala, with a great octagonal space at the crossing,
is in concept and in its actual dimensions more a work of urbanism than of architecture
(Plate <a href='#pl075b'>75<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Built with English capital by an English firm, the City of Milan Improvement
Company Ltd, and even, presumably, with some English professional advice—M.
D. Wyatt was a member of the English board—this tremendous project more than
rivals the greatest Victorian railway stations of London in the height, if not the span, of
its metal-and-glass roof. But the actual designing architect was Italian, Giuseppe Mengoni
(1829-77), and the Galleria de Cristoforis provided him with at least a modest local
prototype. Erected in 1865-77 and now completely restored to its pristine richness and
elegance, the Galleria scheme involved the enlargement of the Piazza del Duomo and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the lining of two of its sides with related façades—executed only partly from Mengoni’s
designs—as also the regularization of the Piazza della Scala. Alessi’s sixteenth-century
Palazzo Marino, itself of almost Second Empire lushness, was enlarged to serve as the
offices of the municipality and provided with a new façade in Alessi’s extreme Mannerist
style across one side of the square facing La Scala. This was carried out in 1888-90 by
Luca Beltrami (1854-1933), who had studied in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts, to
serve as municipal offices.</p>

<p class='c010'>Like all the other most prominent buildings of this period, Mengoni’s Galleria makes
its impression by its size, its elaboration of detail, and above all its unqualified assurance.
From the triumphal-arch portal, rising as high as the nave of the medieval Duomo,
to the gilded arabesques of the pilasters, all is obvious, expensive, and rather parvenu;
yet the setting—at once so comfortable and so magnificent—that it provides for urban
life, centre as it has always remained of so much Milanese activity, has not been
equalled since.<a id="r203"></a><a href='#f203' class='c025'><sup>[203]</sup></a> The Galleria Umberto I in Naples is a late and rather inferior imitation
whose ornate entrance most ungenerously overpowers the San Carlo Theatre across the
street. This was built by Emmanuele Rocco in 1887-90.</p>

<p class='c010'>After Paris the most extensive and sumptuous example of the re-organization of a
great city carried out in this period is not in Italy but in Austria. Vienna had been relatively
inactive architecturally in the first half of the nineteenth century under Francis I
(see Chapter <a href='#ch02'>2</a>). His successor Francis Joseph, however, who came to the throne in 1848,
set out in the following decades as <i>Kaiser</i> and <i>König</i> to see that his Imperial and Royal
capitals should rival Napoleon III’s Paris. In 1857 the fortifications surrounding the old
city of Vienna were removed, and the following year Ludwig Förster (1797-1863) won
the competition for the layout of the Ringstrasse that was to take their place. The
execution of this project, with many modifications, took some thirty years (Plate <a href='#pl074'>74</a>).
Outside the actual walls there had been a wide glacis, and therefore the Ring could be
developed not merely as a series of wide tree-lined boulevards like those of Paris but
with large open spaces in which major public buildings were grouped. These edifices
are even more various in style than the comparable ones in Paris, despite the fact that
they were the work of a very closely knit group of architects. None of them is of specifically
Second Empire character, though the high mansards and the pavilion composition
of the New Louvre were used fairly frequently on private buildings in Vienna and
throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The earliest major project of Francis Joseph was the construction of the Arsenal, begun
in 1849, where most of the leading architects of the period worked (see Chapter <a href='#ch02'>2</a>).
All in various versions of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>, this group of buildings culminates in the
centrally placed Army Museum of 1856-77 by Förster and his Danish son-in-law Theophil
von Hansen (1813-91). On this the very ornate detail is Byzantinesque and
Saracenic in inspiration, yet it is not without a distinctive flavour that is unmistakably
of this particular period: the brilliant polychromy of the red and yellow brick walls
almost seems to echo, like Vaudoyer’s Marseilles cathedral, the bolder effects of the
contemporary High Victorian Gothic architects of England.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ferstel’s bank in the Herrengasse of 1856-60, also <i>Rundbogenstil</i>, has been mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>earlier. The North Railway Station of 1858-65 by Theodor Hoffmann was <i>Rundbogenstil</i>
of an even more ornate sort, with only a rather modest iron-and-glass-roofed shed
set between its two massive masonry blocks. This was badly damaged by bombing in
the last War but not totally destroyed. On the other hand, the South Station, built in
1869-73 by Wilhelm Flattich (1826-1900), a pupil of Leins in Stuttgart, was of rather
conventional High Renaissance character.</p>

<p class='c010'>The typical and, one may suppose, the preferred stylistic vehicle of most Viennese
architects in these decades was, indeed, a rather rich High Renaissance mode. This, for
example, Hansen used very effectively for the Palace of Archduke Eugene of 1865-7
and for the Palais Epstein at 1 Parlamentsring of 1870-3. He and Förster, and after
Förster’s death Hansen alone, as well as many other architects, employed this mode
ubiquitously for various big blocks of flats along the Ring and elsewhere (Plate <a href='#pl074'>74</a>).
Good examples are such new hotels of the period as the former Britannia, still standing
in the Schillerplatz, and the Donau, which once rose opposite the North Station.
Both are by Heinrich Claus (1835-?) and Josef Grosz (1828-?) and were built in the
early seventies. Their rather Barryesque raised end-pavilions, without mansards,
and the heavily sumptuous detailing of the façades are most characteristic. The better
known Sacher’s Hotel behind the Opera House, built by W. Fraenkel in 1876, is
somewhat smaller and less lush, at least externally. The block at 8 Operngasse, built
by Ehrmann in the early sixties, was topped with Parisian mansards, as are also the
long blocks in the Reichstrasse behind the Parlament and the University on either
side of the Rathaus; these also have open arcades at their base somewhat like those in
Turin.</p>

<p class='c010'>As along the boulevards of Paris, there is a considerable homogeneity in the private
architecture that lines the Ring and the many squares and streets that were built up at
the same time. Only in the design of public monuments—often by much the same architects,
it is worth noting—did a pompous and somewhat retardataire eclecticism rule.
Consider the major works of Ferstel: his bank is <i>Rundbogenstil</i>; his Votivkirche of
1856-79 is Gothic; his University something else again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ferstel’s Gothic must be compared, not with the distinctly original High Victorian
churches of its period in England (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>), but with Gau’s earlier Sainte-Clotilde
in Paris (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>): it is certainly a considerable improvement over that in
the general justness of the scale and the plausible laciness of the fourteenth-century detail.
But in English terms the Votivkirche is still Early rather than High Victorian. The
painted decoration by J. Führich and others, somewhat more discreet than that in the
chief <i>Rundbogenstil</i> churches of Vienna, relieves effectively the coldness usual in these
big Continental examples of Neo-Gothic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ferstel’s much later University of 1873-4, which stands next door to his church and
balances Hansen’s precisely contemporaneous Grecian Parlament (see Chapter <a href='#ch02'>2</a>),
is a richly plastic pavilioned composition of generically Renaissance character. It also
has a high convex mansard over the central block like those on the New Louvre, a
feature echoed on the Justizpalast in the Schmerlingplatz, built by Alexander Wielemans
(1843-1911) after the University in 1874-81. So much for the main works of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>leading architect of the period. Not all Ferstel’s contemporaries had quite so varied a
stylistic repertory, however.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Vienna, as in Paris, one of the most conspicuous and also one of the most successful
and original of the new public buildings was the Opera House. This was built in 1861-9
by Van der Nüll &amp; Siccardsburg in a mode quite unrelated to their earlier work at the
Arsenal but one not easy to define. The Vienna Opera House is a somewhat simpler and
less boldly plastic structure than Garnier’s, both in its generally right-angled massing,
with pairs of rectangular wings projecting on each side towards the rear, and in the
rather flat, somewhat <i>François I</i> detail. Yet the vast curved roof, actually rather like that
over the buildings along the Rue de Rivoli, does give it a distinctly Second Empire air
(Plate <a href='#pl074'>74</a>). Less grandly sited than the Paris Opéra, it was none the less balanced across
the Opernring by one of the largest and handsomest of Hansen’s private works, the
Heinrichshof of 1861-3 (Plate <a href='#pl073b'>73<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This had a fine glass-roofed passage through its
centre and ranges of flats behind the elaborate Late Renaissance façades. It has unfortunately
been demolished since the War to make way for a very poor modern block of
offices.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here by the Opera House, as at the Place de l’Opéra in Paris, the Viennese urban
achievement of the age was concentrated. The Heinrichshof, with its raised central portion
matching the high roof of the Opera House opposite and its corner towers corresponding
to the mansarded pavilions of more definitely French-styled blocks of flats,
offered a handsomer Austrian equivalent of the Second Empire mode than does the
Opera House itself; for the Opera House lacks externally the lushness and bombast
characteristic of the period at its most assured, while the auditorium within, re-opened
in 1955, is today a much simplified reconstruction by Erich Boltenstern (b. 1896). Yet the
masonry exterior of the Opera House is clean and fresh today thanks to Boltenstern’s
restoration and, with the great staircase and foyer regilded and refurbished generally, it
offers a lighter and more festive vision of the period than do the vast majority of Viennese
buildings whose stucco so often badly needs a coat of paint.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hansen’s Musikvereinsgebäude of 1867-9 in the Dumbagasse is academic in an almost
eighteenth-century way, both as regards the general organization of the exterior and the
restraint of the detailing. In his still later Parlament of 1873-83, as has been noted earlier,
he produced the last grandiose monument of the Greek Revival. More characteristic,
however, is his contemporaneous Academy of Fine Arts of 1872-6 in the Schillerplatz.
This is externally in the Renaissance mode that he presumably preferred after he left
Athens, but it has Grecian detailing inside of a delicacy and elegance that recalls the
thirties. Especially handsome is the colonnaded Aula in the centre, even though its rich
painted ceiling of 1875-80 by Anselm Feuerbach is inappropriately Baroque in a rather
Rubens-like way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another Austrian architect besides Ferstel was using Gothic for prominent Viennese
edifices in this period (see also Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>). After Ferstel’s Votivkirche the next Neo-Gothic
structure was the Academische Gymnasium in the Beethovenplatz; this was
built in 1863-6 by Friedrich von Schmidt (1825-91), who had worked earlier under
Zwirner on the restoration and completion of Cologne Cathedral. But the school was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>soon outshone in size and in elaboration by Schmidt’s Rathaus of 1872-83. This stands
between Hansen’s Parlament and Ferstel’s University but in a line with the Reichstrasse
at their rear. The Vienna Rathaus is certainly not unrelated to G. G. Scott’s
Victorian Gothic and that of Waterhouse in England, particularly in the side wings
that end, eclectically enough, in high-mansarded pavilions. But the general fussiness
of the turreted front recalls rather pre-Puginian Gothic, say Porden’s Eaton Hall of
seventy years earlier (see Chapters <a href='#ch06'>6</a> and <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the total visual unlikeness of the Rathaus to its Grecian neighbour, the Parlament,
both have a similarly obsolete air. It is as if Francis Joseph’s presumptive intention
in the fifties of outbuilding Napoleon III had been succeeded by a belated and rather
provincial desire to outrival the larger structures in other countries in the two leading
modes of the previous period, the Greek Revival and the Gothic Revival, neither much
represented hitherto in Vienna.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet an equally prominent public monument of the seventies and eighties, the Burgtheater,
which stands just opposite the Rathaus, is of a Late Renaissance, almost Neo-Baroque
order, with a distinctly Second Empire flavour to its bowed front and generally
very plastic composition (Plate <a href='#pl073a'>73<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). This, the most distinguished of all the public
monuments along the Ringstrasse, was built in 1874-88 by Semper, whose international
career in Germany, England, and Switzerland wound up in Vienna after he was called
there in 1871 by Francis Joseph to advise on the extension of the Hofburg Palace.
Except perhaps in its bowed front, this Viennese theatre does not much resemble the
rebuilt Dresden Opera House of 1871-8 which Semper had just designed
(see Chapter <a href='#ch09'>9</a>).
Perhaps Semper and his Viennese partner Karl von Hasenauer (1833-94), a pupil
of Van der Nüll and of Siccardsburg, were somewhat influenced by the plans on
which they were working together for the extension of the nearby palace; these
were, not inappropriately, in the Austrian Baroque of Fischer von Erlach’s unfinished
Michaelertrakt of the Hofburg dating from the second quarter of the
eighteenth century. However that may be, the theatre, boldly scaled and tightly composed,
is a far more successful building than the very derivative Neue Hofburg projecting
out towards the Ring as that was executed in 1881-94 by Hasenauer after
Semper’s death. The post-War restoration of the theatre and the rebuilding of its
auditorium are by Michel Engelhart (b. 1897).</p>

<p class='c010'>Semper and Hasenauer’s two vast Museums of Art History and Natural History face
each other on a large square across the Burgring from the Neue Hofburg. Of identical
design, they were both largely built in 1872-81. In the treatment of the exteriors—they
were finished internally only very much later—as also in some of Hansen’s very latest
work in Vienna, one senses a conscious rejection of the bold plasticity and the compositional
elaboration characteristic of the preceding decades, and most notably of the
Burgtheater. The Renaissance detail is by no means sparse, but there is an academic sort
of primness and orderliness belonging to the last quarter of the century such as has
been noted earlier in Koch’s Roman work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bodenkreditanstalt built by Emil von Förster (1838-1909), Ludwig’s son, in
1884-7 is still more severe in its Florentine <i>quattrocento</i> way, recalling the more Tuscan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>aspects of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. With this may be contrasted the unashamed Neo-Baroque
of Karl König’s Philipphof of 1883, introducing one of the modes most characteristic
of the end of the century in both Austria and Germany.</p>

<p class='c010'>Budapest, the second capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was also much embellished
with public buildings by Francis Joseph. Stüler from Berlin worked here, using
a quiet version of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> for the Academy of Sciences in 1862-4. But the later
and more ornate <i>Rundbogenstil</i> of Berlin and Vienna had already been echoed in Budapest
by Frigyes Feszl (1821-84) in the Vigado Concert Hall of 1859-65. This could
easily be by Ferstel, so similar is it to his bank in Vienna. The leading Hungarian architect
of the period, Miklós Ybl (1814-91), who was trained in Vienna, also used the
<i>Rundbogenstil</i>, but of a rather more Romanesquoid sort, for the Ferenczváros Parish
Church which he built in 1867-78. However, his Renaissance Revival Custom House of
1870-4 is more nearly up to the best Vienna standards of the day as maintained by
Hansen. The Opera House that Ybl built in 1879-84, with its boldly convex mansards,
vies in its rich plasticity with Garnier’s, but none too successfully. The Szent Lukásh
Hotel by R. L. Ray (1845-99), a Swiss-born pupil of Gamier, is one of the largest mansarded
Second Empire hotels anywhere in the western world. On the whole, the dominant
influences in Hungary were Austrian and German, however, not Parisian, as is
hardly surprising. No autochthonous note was struck; as is true of all Eastern Europe,
the architecture of this age is as essentially colonial in character as in the outlying British
Dominions or in Latin America, although the models emulated were rather different.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>In</span> the cities of Germany and of Northern Europe generally there were in this period no
such comprehensive urbanistic developments as in Paris and Vienna. Some individual
public monuments are, perhaps, not inferior to those that Napoleon III and Francis
Joseph obtained from their architects; but these are rarely grouped into such coherent
entities as the Marktplatz in Karlsruhe of the first quarter of the century or the Ludwigstrasse
in Munich of the second quarter. The domestic building of the period is also
considerably less consistent in character than in Paris and Vienna.</p>
<p class='c010'>The architectural scene in Germany was overshadowed by the distinguished achievements
of the previous period. The Schinkel tradition, although increasingly corrupted,
lasted on almost indefinitely not merely in Prussia but in most German states. Stüler,
Schinkel’s ablest disciple in Berlin after the death of the short-lived Persius, remained an
internationally respected practitioner. He was employed in Sweden and in Hungary, as
has been noted, not to speak of German cities, down to his death in 1865. By him and
by many others the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> was employed quite as late as in Austria-Hungary
both in the various German states and also in the Scandinavian countries. Such a very
large and prominent public building as the Berlin Rathaus of 1859-70 by H. F. Waesemann
(1813-79) well indicated the long-continued hold of this mode on German
officialdom. Nor was this particularly inferior in quality to much similar work produced
in the earlier heyday of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i> before 1850. As in Austria, however,
alternative modes were growing increasingly popular, even though none rose to a local
dominance comparable to that of revived Renaissance in Vienna. The taste of the
period for elaboration, both in general composition and in detail, is everywhere evident
regardless of the mode employed.</p>

<p class='c010'>French influence was not absent; indeed, specifically Second Empire features were
perhaps more common than in Austria. G. H. Friedrich Hitzig (1811-81), a former
assistant of Schinkel’s, had actually studied in Paris. After Stüler, he was the most prominent
and successful architect of the period in Berlin, and in the fifties he built a few
mansarded houses there. Along the new Viktoriastrasse in the Tiergarten quarter, where
he did a great deal of work in 1855-60, one house among the eight that he built was
mansarded; the others and most of those he was erecting near by in the Bellevuestrasse,
the Stülerstrasse, and other streets at the same time were, however, in a much elaborated
Schinkelesque vein. Suburban houses of the sixties occasionally followed Parisian
modes also; but far more were clumsy variants of Schinkel’s and Persius’s Italian Villas,
or else in some sort of equally clumsy Gothic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Public buildings in Germany were only occasionally designed in the mansarded mode
and, in general, only after the mid sixties. The Baugewerkschule in Stuttgart, built in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>1866-70 by Josef von Egle (1818-99) its director, had projecting centre and end pavilions
with crudely Parisian detailing. It is curious to realize that it was contemporary
with Leins’s belated but rather distinguished Grecian Königsbau there. In Cologne
the High School of 1860-2, and the Stadttheater of 1870-2 by Julius Raschdorf
(1823-1914), both destroyed in the last War, were heavily mansarded and very plastically
modelled; the latter, at least, on which H. Deutz collaborated with Raschdorf, had
some real compositional interest in the tight interlocking of the masses (Plate <a href='#pl077b'>77<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
Despite their very evidently French character, both were considered by contemporaries
to be ‘German Renaissance’—as, for that matter, was Wieleman’s Justizpalast in
Vienna—because of the specific precedent of much of the detail; German Renaissance
was by this time the latest fashion, but to later eyes these buildings in Cologne were no
more characteristic examples of it than the one in Vienna. Raschdorf is better known in
any case for his much later Neo-Baroque work, notably the Berlin Cathedral, for which
he prepared the design in 1888, although it was not built until 1894-1905.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Military Hospital by F. Heise in Dresden of 1869 was considerably more French
in the strong articulation of the mansarded centre and end pavilions and also in its quite
Parisian detailing than Raschdorf’s contemporary buildings in Cologne. More prominent
in Dresden by far, however, is the Hoftheater, which is not at all French in
character. This was designed in 1871 by Semper after his earlier theatre there had been
destroyed by fire; its construction was supervised by Semper’s son Manfred after he
settled in Vienna, and completed in 1878. Gone was most of the festive grace and delicacy
of his Hamburg and Dresden work of the forties, even though the auditorium was
not dissimilar to the one that had been destroyed. Yet in the arrangement of the interior
and the disposition of the masses this rivals in clarity of organization the opera-houses
of Garnier in Paris and of Van der Nüll &amp; Siccardsburg in Vienna. The plans undoubtedly
owed a great deal to the elaborate studies Semper had made for Ludwig II in
1865-7 for an opera-house to be built in Munich especially for the production of
Wagner’s operas.</p>

<p class='c010'>The relative importance of Berlin was, of course, rising well before its establishment as
the imperial capital in 1871. Friedrich Hitzig’s most considerable public building in
Berlin, the Exchange, built in 1859-63 at the same time that the Rathaus was in construction,
was neither Schinkelesque nor <i>Rundbogenstil</i> but in a rather academic sort of
Late Baroque (Plate <a href='#pl077a'>77<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Hitzig seems to have been consciously recalling what Knobelsdorf
built for Frederick the Great and thus presaging the more overt Neo-Baroque
of the last decades of the century. His later Reichsbank of 1871-6, on the other hand,
was in general considerably more Classical despite its banded and diapered walls in
two colours of brick.</p>

<p class='c010'>The public buildings of Martin K. P. Gropius (1824-80) are also indicative of the
general stylistic stasis of this period in Germany. His Museum of Decorative Art in
Berlin, begun in 1877 and completed in 1881 by Heinrich Schmieden (1835-1913), resembled
Hitzig’s houses of the fifties in its Grecian elaboration; it also recalled Klenze’s
Hermitage Museum, built more than a generation earlier in Petersburg. Gropius &amp;
Schmieden’s still later Gewandhaus in Leipzig of 1880-4, however, is less reminiscent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Schinkel or Klenze and more conventionally academic. This concert hall was renowned
for its superb acoustics.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is easy to forget how much the architects of these decades, apparently obsessed with
stylistic elaboration, were also concerned to incorporate in their buildings all sorts of
technical advances. Iron may show less than in the previous period, but it was quite
consistently used behind the scenes. Central heating, extensive sanitary equipment,
vertical transportation, and various other things that are taken for granted today first
became accepted necessities in these decades. But it was only in the commercial field—and
in England and the United States above all—that such technical innovations influenced
architecture very positively or visibly (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>), however much they
must actually have preoccupied architects who seem today so imitative and retardataire.
The Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin by Franz Schwechten (1841-1924), however, built in
1872-80, did represent a real advance over the principal English railway station of this
period, St Pancras in London of 1863-76, in the clarity and coherence of its organization.
One can hardly say that the shed roof of the Anhalter Bahnhof was in the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>;
yet it is much more happily related in scale and shape to the masonry elements of the
station than are the two parts of that in London, world-famous nonetheless until the
nineties for the unrivalled span of its shed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Architectural activity in Bavaria was of a very different order. The Ludwigsschlösser,<a id="r204"></a><a href='#f204' class='c025'><sup>[204]</sup></a>
the country palaces that Ludwig II of Bavaria erected for his private delectation after he
succeeded Maximilian II in 1864, are the playthings of a monarch mad about Louis XIV.
Linderhof, built in 1870-86, revived a local Bavarian sort of Baroque, and was thus even
more premonitory of a favourite German mode of the eighties and nineties than Hitzig’s
Berlin Exchange (Plate <a href='#pl084'>84</a>). Herrenchiemsee, first projected as early as 1868 but begun
only in 1878, is a direct imitation of Versailles. Neuschwanstein, on the other hand, is a
wild Wagnerian fantasy of a medieval castle occupying a superb mountain site.</p>

<p class='c010'>It must be assumed that the architect of the first two, Georg von Dollmann (1830-95),
was little more than the draughting agent of his master’s dreams of grandeur. More
interesting than the exteriors are the incredibly rich interiors of Linderhof, operatic recreations
of the Bavarian Rococo. Appropriately enough these were designed by Franz
von Seitz (1817-83), then director of the Munich State Theatre, who was famous for his
stage-sets. At Herrenchiemsee, however, many of the interiors were exact copies of the
main apartments of Louis XIV at Versailles. These were executed by Julius Hoffmann
(1840-96), who began to work under Dollmann in 1880 and succeeded him in 1884.
More original were certain other rooms at Herrenchiemsee designed by F. P. Stulberger
after 1883 in an even more elaborate and fantastic Neo-Rococo than those by Seitz at
Linderhof.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ludwig II had another obsession besides the majesty of Louis XIV, and that was the
genius of Richard Wagner. This cult is almost nauseatingly reflected at Neuschwanstein,
for which Riedel, who had built Schloss Berg in 1849-51, prepared the original design in
1867. Construction there began in 1869, was taken over by Dollmann in 1874, and only
completed as regards the exterior in 1881; much of the decoration is still later. Despite
Ludwig’s romantic love of the real Romanesque of the Wartburg, Neuschwanstein
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>really differs very little from the fake castles of the first half of the century, except in its
very ingenious adaptation to a most precarious site. It is the later interiors, designed by
Hoffmann in the early eighties, that attempt to realize the Wagnerian legends both in the
architectural detailing and in endless murals. The whole culminates in the Byzantinesque
throne room of 1885-6 intended by Ludwig to be a sort of ‘Grail Hall’ from
<i>Parsifal</i>. The results of his other obsession are more gratifying to the eye.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never again would any ruler, however, not even in Germany, be so spendthrift a
patron of architecture. Considering the deterioration in quality evident in these palaces
and castles of the seventies and eighties from the work done for Ludwig’s predecessor
Ludwig I or for Frederick William IV of Prussia in the thirties and forties, this was just
as well. Fortunately the activities of William II were less related to the building arts;
and Hitler, a thwarted architect, had too little time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far more typical of the turn German architecture in general was taking in the seventies
than the Ludwigsschlösser were such things as the von Tiele house in Berlin by
Gustav Ebe (1834-1916) and Julius Benda (1838-97). In its crawlingly rich German
Renaissance detail and its irregularly gabled silhouette this prepared the way far more
definitely than Raschdorf’s contemporary Cologne buildings for a veritable flood of
such coarse work all over Germany in the next decade. This characteristic German
mode has analogies with the English style-phase of the seventies and eighties somewhat
perversely known as ‘Queen Anne’; more specifically it often resembles very closely
what is called ‘Pont Street Dutch’ in England. But leadership comparable to that provided
in England by Webb and Shaw was entirely lacking, and even lesser talent of
the order of George’s or Collcutt’s (see Chapter <a href='#ch12'>12</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Usually executed in dark-coloured brick with stone trim, this prime manifestation
of the bourgeois ambitions of the Bismarckian Empire produced a spate of buildings of
all sorts that have come to look very grim indeed with the accumulated smoke of years.
Old photographs indicate that many of them once had a certain lightness and even a
quite festive air, Wagnerian in the <i>Meistersinger</i> vein rather than in that of the <i>Ring</i> as at
Neuschwanstein. But the materials used were always hard and mechanically handled
and the execution of the detail at once fussy and metallic. No positive originality in
general composition or in planning made up, as with much comparable work in England,
for the anti-architectonic character of the basic approach.</p>

<p class='c010'>A prominent late example is the Rathaus<a id="r205"></a><a href='#f205' class='c025'><sup>[205]</sup></a> in Hamburg built in 1886-97. This vast
and turgid edifice contrasts most unhappily with the suave High Renaissance design of
Wimmel &amp; Forsmann’s contiguous Exchange built in the thirties. Its tall tower, moreover,
has neither the richness of outline of Scott’s on the Nikolaikirche nor the simple
directness of de Chateauneuf’s on the Petrikirche, with both of which it still disputes the
central position on the Hamburg skyline.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nationalistic ‘Meistersinger mode’, so to call it, had only too long a life, lasting
well into the twentieth century. But it was early challenged by a new modulation of
German taste in the eighties, parallel to that which the English also experienced, towards
an eighteenth-century revival—here in Germany definitely Neo-Baroque—of
which Linderhof was probably the first really sumptuous and striking example. Ebe &amp;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Benda early deserted the German Renaissance for a German Baroque at least as chastened
as that of Hitzig’s much earlier Exchange when they built their Palais Mosse in
Berlin of 1882-4. In 1882 Paul Wallot (1841-1912), who had also worked earlier in the
Meistersinger mode, won the competition for the Reichstag Building with an overpoweringly
monumental Neo-Baroque project recalling Vanbrugh more than Bernini
or Schlüter. Erected by him in 1884-94, this was soon matched at the inner end of
Unter den Linden by Raschdorf’s cathedral.</p>

<p class='c028'>Unlike Napoleon III and Francis Joseph, the German emperors William I, Frederick I,
and William II did not succeed in making their capital an important exemplar of nineteenth-century
urbanism. Moreover, the influential position that Germany had occupied
in the international world of architecture in the first half of the century was less and less
maintained after the death of Stüler. Not until the twentieth century did Germans again
make a significant contribution to European architectural history (see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>With the deterioration of German leadership in the seventies and eighties went also a
general decline in the architectural standards of the Scandinavian countries that had so
successfully based their later Romantic Classicism and their <i>Rundbogenstil</i> on German
models of the thirties, forties, and fifties. In Denmark the work of Meldahl was increasingly
inferior to that of Herholdt. Although he was only nine years younger than Herholdt,
his direction of the Copenhagen Academy, beginning in 1873, coincided with the
feeblest and most eclectic period in Danish architecture, from which recovery started
only in the nineties with the early work of Martin Nyrop (1849-1925) in Copenhagen
and of Hack Kampmann (1856-1920) in Aarhus (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>A characteristic urbanistic development of the seventies in Copenhagen, the Søtorvet
built in 1873-6 by Vilhelm Petersen (1830-1913) and Ferdinand Vilhelm Jensen (1837-90),
is French not German in its ultimate inspiration. This grandiose pavilioned and
mansarded range of four tall blocks forms a shallow
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped
square along a canal
(Figure <a href='#i156b'>16</a>). Its definitely Second Empire character may not, all the same, have derived
directly from Paris but via German or English intermediaries, so much more typical is
this of the international than of the truly Parisian mode of the third quarter of the
century.</p>

<p class='c010'>As late as 1893-4 the much more conspicuous Magasin du Nord department store,
built by A. C. Jensen (1847-1913) and his partner H. Glaesel in the Kongens Nytorv in
Copenhagen, also carried the high mansarded roofs of the new Louvre, both flat-sided
and convex-curved, above its end and centre pavilions. The detailing was chastened,
however, by memories of local palaces and mansions in the nearby Amalie quarter of
the city, where Jensen had worked on the completion of the eighteenth-century Marble
Church. The Magasin du Nord thus combines two characteristic aspects of the architecture
of the period, evident in most countries but rarely thus joined: a reflection of
Napoleon III’s Paris, elsewhere reaching its peak around 1870, and a revival of the style
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, generally beginning about a decade later.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Sweden also there was some Second Empire influence, although nothing very
notable resulted from it. The Jernkontovets Building in Stockholm erected by the
brothers Kumlien (A.F., 1833-?; K.H., 1837-97) in 1873-5 has a high mansard and
pavilions combined with a respectably academic treatment of the façades that is quite
different from the bombast of the Søtorvet. Bern’s Restaurant in Stockholm of 1886 by
Åbom, whose more conservative Renaissance Revival theatre of thirty years earlier has
been mentioned, is similarly Parisian, particularly in the decorations that were provided
by Isaeus.</p>

<p class='c010'>With I. G. Clason (1856-1930) the tide of eclecticism in Sweden turned more nationalistic.
The Northern Renaissance of his Northern Museum, built in 1889-1907, parallels
somewhat belatedly the Meistersinger mode in Germany; but it also shows a more
refined and delicate touch, somewhat like that of George and of Collcutt in England.
As in most other countries, the revival of the native sixteenth-century style was soon
succeeded by a revival of the Baroque, here rather academically restrained. This phase
is most conspicuously represented in Stockholm by the grouped Parliament House and
National Bank of 1897-1905 by Aron Johansson (1860-1936). In the nineties Ferdinand
Boberg (1860-1946) was also initiating a new movement somewhat comparable to
that led by Nyrop in Denmark (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The modes of Second Empire Paris left rather more mark on Holland than did those
of the First Empire, particularly in the work of Cornelis Outshoorn (1810-75), whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>iron-and-glass Paleis voor Volksvlijt in Amsterdam of the late fifties has been mentioned
earlier. That is long gone, but the related Galerij, a
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped
range of mansarded blocks linked by a sort of veranda of cast iron,
till lately bounded the south of the Frederiksplein. His enormous
Amstel Hotel, near by on the farther side of the Amstel, was built in
1863-7. At Scheveningen the Oranje Hotel (1872-3), also by him, was
one of several typical resort establishments there of an international
Second Empire order, as is also his hotel at Berg-en-Dal near Nijmegen
(1867-9). Fairly generally high mansards rose in the sixties and
seventies over the narrow house-fronts in the new quarters of Dutch
cities. However, the opposing Neo-Gothic is more significant
historically in Holland, and the secular work of Cuijpers as well as
his churches, although rather like Clason’s, is better considered in
that connexion (see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>). As in the Scandinavian
countries, the nineties saw new beginnings in Holland, in this case
with the appearance of Berlage and Kromhout (see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The principal Anglo-American developments in the second half of the
century were in the specialized fields of domestic and commercial
building (see Chapters <a href='#ch14'>14</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). England, moreover,
had from 1850 to the early seventies a lively stylistic development of
her own, the High Victorian Gothic, rather different from the later
Neo-Gothic of the Continent, which was also very influential in the
Dominions and in the United States (see Chapters <a href='#ch10'>10</a> and <a href='#ch11'>11</a>).
Nevertheless, the international Second Empire mode flourished on both
sides of the Atlantic among Anglo-Saxons to a greater extent, perhaps,
than anywhere in Europe. It is not, of course, possible to subsume all
non-Gothic work of these decades in England under the Second Empire
rubric any more than on the Continent. Yet, with certain notable
exceptions, the most vigorous and conspicuous buildings of a
generically Renaissance character were clearly inspired by Paris, and
often specifically by the New Louvre, as Prosper Mérimée noted and
wrote to Viollet-le-Duc while on a visit to London in the mid sixties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most considerable English public monument built just after the mid century, the
Leeds Town Hall of 1855-9, is by Cuthbert Brodrick (Plate <a href='#pl078a'>78<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). That Brodrick was an
architect markedly French in his leanings has already been noted in describing his Leeds
Corn Exchange, which is later in date but earlier in style than his Town Hall (see
Chapter 4). But this major early work, for which Brodrick won the commission in a
competition in 1853, is not easily pigeon-holed stylistically. The great hall inside derives
quite directly from Elmes’s in Liverpool, designed almost a quarter of a century earlier,
though not opened until 1856. The exterior recalls in its grandiose scale the English
Baroque of Vanbrugh more than it does anything that had even been projected since
the megalomaniac French projects of the 1790s. The Leeds Town Hall is certainly no
longer Romantic Classical, no longer Early Victorian; yet except for the rather clumsy
originality of some of the detail and the varied outline of the tower—a late emendation
of the original project of 1853—it is hard to say how or why it is so definitely High
Victorian, and rather a masterpiece of the High Victorian at that. Wallot in Berlin in
the eighties approached Brodrick’s mode of design in the Reichstag but had little of his
command of scale or his almost Romantic Classical control of mass.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Brodrick designed his town hall very little was known in England of Visconti’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>project of 1852 for the New Louvre, and Lefuel had not yet begun to elaborate the design.
So vigorously individual an architect as Brodrick was hardly likely, moreover, to
find inspiration in the Hope house of Dusillion or the Hardwicks’ Great Western Hotel.
But the wave of Second Empire influence arrived in England well before the Leeds
Town Hall was finished. When the English swarmed to Paris to visit the International
Exhibition of 1855 the character of the New Louvre became generally known to architects
and to the interested public. The Crimean War in the mid fifties served, moreover,
to bring English and French officialdom into close contact. To English ministers and
civil servants, even more than to architects and ordinary citizens, the existing governmental
accommodations in Whitehall contrasted most unfavourably with those Napoleon
III was providing in the New Louvre. When a competition was held in 1856-7 for
a new Foreign Office and a new War Office to be built in Whitehall, it is not surprising
that most of those entrants who were not convinced Gothicists should have modelled
their projects more or less on the work of Visconti and Lefuel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Barry, the head of the profession, did not enter the competition; but unofficially—for
he was still an employee of the Government at the Houses of Parliament—he prepared
at this time a comprehensive scheme for the development of the whole length of Whitehall
from Parliament Square to Trafalgar Square. In this project he crowned all his
façades—including that of his already executed Treasury—with mansards, introduced
stepped-back courts like that of the New Louvre, and marked the corners and the centres
of the court façades in the most Louvre-like way with pavilions crowned by still taller
mansards. Had this project of Barry’s been followed, London would rival Paris and
Vienna in the extent, the consistency, and the boldness of her public buildings of this
period. In fact, practically nothing ever came of it nor, indeed, of the official competition;
for by this period earlier traditions of urbanism had all but completely died out
and architectural initiative was largely in private hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the competition was judged in 1857, the designs that received the top prizes
both for the War Office and for the Foreign Office were in the pavilioned and mansarded
manner; they derived, however, at least as much from the Tuileries as from the
New Louvre. It was the rising prestige of Napoleon III, of course, that called public
attention at this time to the Tuileries which was his residence—as it had been, for that
matter, the residence of earlier nineteenth-century French monarchs. Otherwise no one
in England would probably have thought of reviving any of the various periods,
covering some four centuries, represented in its conglomerate mass or of emulating its
pavilioned and mansarded composition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since neither of these projects for ministries was ever executed, and their respective
architects—Henry B. Garling (1821-1909), on the one hand, and H. E. Coe (1826-85)
and his partner Hofland, on the other—never built much else of consequence, it is not
necessary to linger over them. However, their designs and other Second Empire ones
that received minor premiums were extensively illustrated in professional and general
periodicals, and they provided favourite models in the sixties both in England and in the
United States. The Paris originals, on which graphic data was not only scarcer but also
less readily accessible, were not on the whole so influential. This helps to explain why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>French influence <i>appears</i> to have been stronger in the Anglo-Saxon world than on the
Continent, even though there was probably less direct contact with Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was also in England at this time a general tendency, even more notable than in
Austria or Germany, to enrich and elaborate plastically the long-established Renaissance
Revival mode. This is less specifically inspired by Paris. An excellent example is provided
by the extensive range of terraces, designed by Sancton Wood (1814-86) in
1857, that flank Lancaster Gate in the Bayswater Road in London with their boldly projecting
bay windows linked by tiers of colonnades. In other examples, such as the
National Discount Company’s offices at 65 Cornhill built by the Francis Brothers in
1857, the capping of the whole block with a boldly dormered mansard<a id="r206"></a><a href='#f206' class='c025'><sup>[206]</sup></a> is more
obviously of Second Empire inspiration, though the façades below are merely of a much
enriched <i>palazzo</i> order.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Moseley Brothers designed in 1858 the vast Westminster Palace Hotel
near Westminster Abbey at the foot of Victoria Street, a caravanserai intended to exceed
the Hardwicks’ Great Western Hotel of 1850-2 in international luxury, they took over
its pavilioned and mansarded design. To judge from the relative dignity and sobriety
of their detailing, they would seem to have studied contemporary Parisian work—not
the New Louvre but the quieter <i>maisons de rapport</i> along the boulevards—rather than
merely basing themselves on the prize-winning Government Offices projects as so many
others were content to do at this time. This hotel, which proved a failure, now serves
as a block of offices, and has been remodelled almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next year Barry designed the Halifax Town Hall, his last work. He did not himself
propose to cap this, like the Government Offices in his Whitehall scheme, with
French mansards; those that were executed are an emendation by his son, E. M. Barry,
who carried the building to completion in 1862 after his father’s death in 1860. But the
richly arcaded articulation of the walls and the emphatic forward breaks of the great
tower and of the more modest pavilion at the other end clearly emulate, without directly
imitating, the sumptuous plasticity of the New Louvre. Nevertheless, the boldly asymmetrical
composition, dominated by a single corner tower, is more in the Italian Villa
vein (Plate <a href='#pl078b'>78<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>This tower—but not the site—was lined up with the axis of Prince’s Street, which
enters Crossley Street at this point. The assured quality of its design and above all that of
its tremendous spire, more than worthy of Wren in the ingenuity with which the silhouette
of a Gothic steeple was built up out of Renaissance elements, makes the Halifax
Town Hall thoroughly English and one of the masterpieces of the High Victorian period.
Totally devoid of Gothic elements, it has more Gothic vitality than Barry’s Houses of
Parliament, at this time just approaching completion nearly thirty years after they were
first designed.</p>

<p class='c010'>E. M. Barry went on to crown two London station hotels, that at Charing Cross in
1863-4 and that at Cannon Street in 1865-6, with mansards; but these were far from being
masterpieces, and that at Charing Cross has lately been much modified. The Grosvenor
Hotel, built beside the new Victoria Station in 1859-60 by Sir James T. Knowles
(1831-1908), is far more original. He covered the whole enormous mass with a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>tall convex mansard, giving further emphasis to the broad pavilions at the ends by
carrying their roofs still higher and capping them with lanterns. Beyond this nothing
was French. The detail indeed, defined by its architect as ‘Tuscan’, i.e. <i>Rundbogenstil</i>,
is highly individual, partaking of the coarse gusto and even somewhat of the naturalism
of the most advanced Victorian Gothic foliage carving of the period (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Similar mansards, but flat-sided not bulbous, and similar detail characterize a pair of
tall terraces that Knowles built in 1860 on the north side of Clapham Common, south
of London. These constituted a subtle suburban attack on Early Victorian traditions
of terrace-design that soon had metropolitan repercussions. His Thatched House Club
in St James’s Street in London of 1865 has a great deal of very rich carving by J. Daymond
in the naturalistic vein, but is less interesting in general composition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Knowles’s Grosvenor was still new when John Giles outbid it with the Langham Hotel,
begun in 1864. Given a much finer site than Knowles’s at the base of the broad avenue
of Portland Place across from Nash’s All Souls’, Langham Place, Giles rose boldly—most
people now think too boldly—to the occasion (Plate <a href='#pl080a'>80<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Certainly he overwhelmed
Nash’s delicate and ingenious steeple by the rounded projection and the tall
square corner tower—now bombed away at the top—with which he faced it. Equally
certainly his massive north façade, with its boldly modelled flanking pavilions and its
profusion of lively animal carvings, would overwhelm the urbane refinement of the
nearby Adam terraces flanking Portland Place had these not by now been replaced by
far inferior buildings. For all its gargantuan scale and the somewhat elephantine playfulness
of the detail (not to speak of the dinginess to which the ‘Suffolk-white’ brickwork
and the stone trim have now been reduced), the Langham is a rich and powerfully
plastic composition, most skilfully adapted to a special site, and more original than most
of what was produced in the sixties in Paris. The carved animals at the window heads,
so varied and so humorous, deserve an attention they rarely receive; these scurrying
creatures almost seem to come out of Tenniel, but may actually derive from Viollet-le-Duc.</p>

<p class='c010'>That this degree of architectural originality, presented with such bold assurance and
even bombast, should within a decade or two have come to seem tasteless and actually
ugly—as, indeed, it has seemed to many ever since—is not of major historical consequence.
The age that achieved it rejected as tasteless and insipid the architectural production
of the previous hundred years, and most notably Late Georgian work of the
sort to which the Langham stood in close proximity. What <i>is</i> of consequence is that
such High Victorian buildings, even when not Gothic, possessed a vitality and a contemporaneity
within their period that was very largely lacking in parallel work on the
Continent, most of which in any case is a decade or more later in date. In their parvenu
brashness, the Grosvenor and Langham balance the contemporary achievement of the
Gothic church architects—an achievement generally more acceptable even today as it
was already to highbrows and aesthetics in the sixties—without necessarily equalling it
(see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the English hotel boom of the early and mid sixties which these big London hotels
set off, some variant of the anglicized Second Empire became the accepted type of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>design; indeed, a mansarded French mode continued to be used as late as the nineties<a id="r207"></a><a href='#f207' class='c025'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
for such a big London hotel as the Carlton built by H. L. Florence (1843-1916) in
1897. Many heavily mansarded London hotels of the seventies and eighties are now
gone or have been turned, like the earlier Westminster Palace and the Langham, to other
uses—among these the former Grand Hotel in Trafalgar Square of 1878-80 by H.
Francis and the front block of the former Cecil in the Strand built in 1886 by Perry
&amp; Reed may at least be noted here, since they remain so conspicuous and are so exasperatingly
unavailable to travellers.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a resort hotel, however, the Cliff (now the Grand) at Scarborough in Yorkshire,
built by Brodrick at the height of the boom in 1863-7, just before he retired to live in
France, that remains internationally the most notable example of the type
(Plate <a href='#pl079'>79</a>).
And the type could be found in such remote spots as the famous ‘ghost town’ of the
Comstock Lode, Virginia City, Nevada, where the large and elaborate hotel is no
more, or Leadville, Colorado, where the more modest and much later Vendome
Hotel, built by Senator Tabor for his ‘Baby Doe’, is still in use, as well as in big European
cities such as Amsterdam, Frankfort, Brussels, and Budapest.</p>

<p class='c010'>The site of Brodrick’s Grand Hotel is a superb one on the edge of the Scarborough
cliffs above the North Sea, as different as possible from the setting of the New Louvre.
Its corner pavilions are capped, not with ordinary high mansards, but with curious roofs
like pointed domes, richly crowned with elaborate cornices. In the intricacy of their
silhouette these are not unworthy rivals of Barry’s Halifax tower. The massive walls
are not of freestone in the manner of Paris nor yet of pallid Suffolk brick with light
coloured stone or cement trim as in London. Instead, they are of warm red brick with
incredibly lush decorative trim of tawny terracotta—a combination that M. D. Wyatt
also used on the most elegant Second Empire mansion in London, Alford House, which
stood from 1872 until 1955 in Prince’s Gate at the corner of Ennismore Gardens
(Plate <a href='#pl083a'>83<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Public and private architecture could hardly hope to rival the sumptuousness of the
new hotels, and in Britain rarely attempted to do so. At Liverpool T. H. Wyatt in
1864-9 carried a
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped
range of ornately pavilioned and mansarded blocks that
housed the Exchange around the open space at the rear of the Town Hall, somewhat
as Outshoorn carried his Galerij around the Paleis voor Volksvlijt in Amsterdam; but
that is now all gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the English countryside, the Bowes Museum at Barnard Castle in County Durham,
built in 1869-75 by J.-A.-F.-A. Pellechet (1829-1903), and Waddesdon Manor
in Buckinghamshire by another French architect, G.-H. Destailleur (1822-93), largely
of 1880-3, are unique examples of extensive mansions completely in the Second Empire
mode (Plate <a href='#pl076b'>76<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). In London Montagu House, designed in 1866 by the elderly Burn for
the Duke of Buccleuch, once raised in Whitehall the mansarded pavilions that Barry
and the winners of the Government Offices competition had proposed in 1857, but
this has now been demolished.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most notable Second Empire ensemble in London, however, still partly survives
(Plate <a href='#pl080b'>80<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Facing the gardens of Buckingham Palace and extending southward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>from the group of Late Georgian monuments around Hyde Park Corner, are the terraces
of Grosvenor Place. These were designed<a id="r208"></a><a href='#f208' class='c025'><sup>[208]</sup></a> in 1867 and built in the following years.
They provide one of the more striking features of the London skyline inherited from
the Victorian period. Rivalling the high roofs and, almost, the tall steeples of the
Victorian Gothic, the mansards over the end houses are carried to fantastic heights and
capped with pointed upper roofs, providing several storeys of attics; while the centre
houses have convex mansards like square domes taken straight from the New Louvre.</p>

<p class='c010'>Below these Alpine crests, elaborated at the base with rich stone dormers, the enormous
houses are all of fine Portland stone—hardly to be found in any earlier nineteenth-century
London terraces except those of Ennismore Gardens—and detailed with a
plausibly Parisian flair—it is even said that draughtsmen were sent to Paris to study
Second Empire work at first hand. English are the porches, however, which make plain
that these pretentious ranges are rows of dwellings like those in nearby Belgrave
Square. English, also, are the red stone bands, novel touches echoing the fashionable
‘structural polychrome’ of the contemporary Victorian Gothic, just as the tall mansards
echo its pointed roofs (see Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond the first two blocks of Grosvenor Place the new construction of the sixties
stops; but it starts again at the farther end and surrounds the two triangles of Grosvenor
Gardens, of which Knowles’s hotel occupies part of the farther side. It is characteristic
of the Parisian inspiration of the whole that on the east side of the Gardens great blocks
of flats—’mansions’ in a Victorian euphemism—replaced the usual London terraces of
individual tall houses, but these now serve as offices as do all the extant houses in Grosvenor
Place. For one of these blocks red brick was used, but set like a mere panel-filling
within stone frames according to a French rather than an English tradition.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are no other comparably pretentious examples of Second Empire terraces in
London except Cambridge Gate (1875) by Thomas Archer and A. Green (?-1904), an unhappy
intrusion among Nash’s stuccoed Regent’s Park ranges despite its handsome execution
in fine ashlar of Bath stone. Characteristically, London domestic architecture of the
late fifties and sixties merely elaborated the Renaissance Revival formulas of the previous
decade. Not only were the chosen models generally later and richer as in Vienna;
wherever possible bolder plastic effects were achieved by a more extensive use of ground-storey
colonnades, first-storey porches, and projecting bay windows, as on Wood’s
magniloquent terraces at Lancaster Gate or those of 1858 by C. J. Richardson (1800-72)
that followed them in Queen’s Gate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The high standards of the earlier period were maintained only in business <i>palazzi</i>,
not those of London’s City, but those in big Northern towns like Bradford and in Scotland.
There good freestone was readily available and a certain cultural lag, as well as a
regional sobriety of temperament, led to the maintenance of a more Barry-like tradition.
Notable everywhere for their academic virtues are the various National Provincial Bank
buildings by Barry’s pupil John Gibson (1819-92). The earliest, but not the most
typical, is the head office in Bishopsgate, which was begun in 1863.</p>

<p class='c010'>A special school of Renaissance design is associated with Sir Henry Cole’s Department
of Practical Art, and this produced the various buildings that he sponsored in the new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>London cultural centre in Brompton (now usually called South Kensington). The Exhibition
of 1862, on the southern edge of the estate belonging to the Commissioners of
the Great Exhibition, was housed in a structure designed by Francis Fowke (1823-65),
an army engineer. As at the Paris Exhibition of 1855, the metal and glass construction of
this was masked externally with masonry walls, but, unlike Cendrier’s and Viel’s Palais
de l’Industrie, the whole was pavilioned and mansarded in the Second Empire mode.
A still more elaborate Second Empire project was prepared by Fowke for the Museum
of Science and Art (later Victoria and Albert), Cole having evidently accepted all too
abjectly the criticism of his earlier temporary structure, the notorious ‘Brompton
Boilers’ (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>). As Fowke died at this point the Museum (Plate <a href='#pl083b'>83<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), begun in
1866, as also the associated Royal College of Science (Huxley Building), built in
1868-71, were carried out in a much less French vein under another army engineer,
H. G. D. Scott (1822-83). The walling material is a fine smooth red brick, very rare in
the London of the nineteenth century, beautifully laid up with thin joints. With this is
combined an enormous quantity of elaborately modelled pale cream terracotta, as on
various Central European buildings deriving from Schinkel’s Bauakademie in Berlin of
1831-6.</p>

<p class='c010'>In these South Kensington structures, planned by an engineer, the emphasis is on the
sculptural embellishment designed and executed by Godfrey Sykes and other artists
associated with the Department. This team-work, by-passing as it did over-all control by
an architect, was not very successful in achieving the coherence of Knowles’s and Giles’s
hotels, although those were built for much less sophisticated clients. Much the same
team, but with still more sculptors collaborating, was responsible for the Albert Hall,
the vast circular auditorium built in 1867-71 on the northern edge of the Commissioners’
Estate facing the most characteristic monument of the age, G. G. Scott’s Victorian
Gothic Albert Memorial. The engineer Scott’s really notable achievement here in
the metal construction of the vast dome is unfortunately swamped by the profuse investiture
of sculptural detail in terracotta, intrinsically elegant though much of that is.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the sixties there was some coherence in the planning of the Commissioners’ Estate
as a whole, with a garden court surrounded by a great hemicycle of terracotta arcading
by M. D. Wyatt lying behind the 1862 Exhibition Building and below the Albert Hall.
In Vienna the cultural edifices were admirably grouped along the Ringstrasse with
plenty of open space between them, however much they may have lacked intrinsic
architectural quality. In sad contrast is the way the following decades allowed this considerable
tract to become clogged up until almost no urbanistic organization at all
remains.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other European countries tended in this period, like Denmark, Sweden, and Holland,
to follow Paris and Vienna rather than London. Only a few works of the sixties and
seventies need be singled out from the welter of pretentious public and private construction
that turned Brussels, for example, into a ‘Little Paris’.<a id="r209"></a><a href='#f209' class='c025'><sup>[209]</sup></a> The Boulevard Anspach as a
whole suggests the Cannebière in Marseilles, although the mansards on the buildings
that line it are more plastically handled; the Exchange, in its own square half-way down
the boulevard, was built by L.-P. Suys (1823-87) in 1868-73, and this provides the focus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of the mid-nineteenth-century city, as does Garnier’s Opéra in Paris. A provincial
variant of the Opéra in many ways, despite its quite different function, this is somewhat
more academic in composition yet also rather coarser in its profuse ornamentation.
Brussels as a whole is dominated, however, by one of the grandest and most original
monuments erected anywhere in this period.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Palace of Justice,<a id="r210"></a><a href='#f210' class='c025'><sup>[210]</sup></a> built by Joseph Poelaert (1817-79) in 1866-83, occupies so high a
site and is mounted on so mountainous a substructure that almost the whole of its gargantuan
mass is visible from all over the city. Although generically Classical, a good deal
of the external treatment has an indefinable flavour of the monuments of the ancient
civilizations of the East, somewhat like that of the exotic churches Alexander Thomson
built in the late fifties and sixties in Glasgow (Plate <a href='#pl081'>81</a>). Even more than Thomson’s
relatively small and delicately scaled work, the Palace of Justice also suggests the megalomaniac
architectural dreams of such a Romantic English painter as John Martin. Heavy
and almost literally cruel, it has a Piranesian spatial elaboration and a plastic vitality of
the most exaggeratedly architectonic order. Thus it quite puts to shame the urbane
Renaissance costuming of most Continental public architecture of this period and the
usual Neo-Baroque of the next.</p>

<p class='c010'>The existence of this extraordinary edifice in a minor European capital prepares one a
little for the important part that Brussels was to play in the nineties, even though there
could hardly be two architects further apart in spirit than Poelaert and Victor Horta,
who initiated there the Art Nouveau (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). So also in Glasgow, the originality
of Thomson’s Queen’s Park Church of the sixties at least opened the way for the
notable international contribution to be made by the Glaswegian C. R. Mackintosh in
the nineties. But it was Alphonse Balat (1818-95), not Poelaert, who was Horta’s master
and also in these decades professor of architecture at the local Academy. Balat’s Musée
Royale des Beaux Arts of 1875-81 already represents a reversion to a more restrained
and academic classicism with none of Poelaert’s force and vitality. Yet this building is
not without a certain correct elegance of detail and conventional skill in composition
for which his houses of the sixties, with their Barry-like handling of the High Renaissance
<i>palazzo</i> theme, prepared the way. The real eclecticism of this period lies less significantly
in the variety of nominal styles employed than in the variety of ways of employing
them. It is this, rather than the concurrent multiplication of fashionable modes, that
makes it so difficult to characterize broadly the production of the period between the
mid century and the nineties.</p>

<p class='c010'>In several other European countries the situation was made even more complicated
than in Belgium by a very considerable cultural lag such as has already been noted in
Scandinavia. While the Rütschi-Bleuler House in Zurich of 1869-70 by Theodor Geiger
(1832-82) had the fashionable Second Empire mansard, here high and concave, at nearby
Winterthur Semper’s Town Hall of precisely the same date, with its dominating temple
portico, might at first sight be taken for a provincial French public edifice of the second
quarter of the century. At the Zurich Polytechnic School, where Semper became a professor
in 1855,<a id="r211"></a><a href='#f211' class='c025'><sup>[211]</sup></a> the large building begun in 1859 that he erected with the local architect
Wolff is equally retardataire in style. His Observatory there of 1861-4 is a delicate and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>rather picturesquely composed exercise in the <i>quattrocento</i> version of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>,
rather like his Hamburg houses of twenty years earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>If a German architect of established international reputation could be thus affected by
the conservative tastes of his Swiss clients, it is not surprising that in the Iberian peninsula
almost nothing of interest was built in this period. It may, however, be mentioned
that the building for the National Library and Museums in Madrid, designed in 1866
by Francisco Jareño y Alarcón (1818-92) and almost thirty years in construction, while
still of the most conventional Classical character as regards its façades, has convex mansards
over the end pavilions of quite definitely Second Empire character. Characteristically,
the Chamber of Commerce in Madrid, completed in 1893 by E. M. Repulles y
Vargas (1845-1922), illustrates the general return of official architecture to still more
conventional academic standards towards the end of the century. But in the seventies
there began in Barcelona the career of a Spanish—or more accurately Catalan—architect,
Antoni Gaudí, who was destined to produce around 1900 some of the boldest and most
original early works of modern architecture. Gaudí’s real links in the seventies and
eighties, spiritually if not so much actually, are with the High Victorian Gothic not the
Second Empire, although the earliest project on which he worked reflected the Palais
Longchamps at Marseilles (see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The situation in the United States was naturally most like that in England. As has
already been noted, a French-trained Danish architect, Lienau, prefigured the Second
Empire mode in the Shiff house in New York as early as 1849-50. By the mid fifties
mansards of rather modest height, often with shallow concave slopes, had appeared in
Eastern cities on many houses not otherwise particularly Frenchified. Richard M. Hunt
(1827-95),<a id="r212"></a><a href='#f212' class='c025'><sup>[212]</sup></a> the first American to study at the École des Beaux-Arts and actually an
assistant as well as a pupil of Lefuel, returned from Paris to America in 1855. But he
brought with him no lush Second Empire mode but rather the basic academic tradition of
the French official world, despite the fact that he had himself worked in 1854 on the
New Louvre. Although some of the earliest work of H. H. Richardson, who returned
from Paris a decade later after working for several years for Labrouste’s brother
Théodore, was of Second Empire character, he showed himself from the
first more responsive to influences from contemporary England
(see Chapters <a href='#ch11'>11</a> and <a href='#ch13'>13</a>). On the whole, the Second Empire
mode, as it was practised in America through the third quarter of the
century, derived almost as completely as the local Victorian Gothic
from England. Most American architects were kept informed of what was
going on abroad through the English professional Press, and so they
naturally followed the models that were offered in the <i>Builder</i>
and the <i>Building News</i> rather than those in the publications of
César Daly.<a id="r213"></a><a href='#f213' class='c025'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Civil War of 1861-5 did not bring architectural production to a stop; indeed, it
seems to have had a less inhibiting effect than the aftermath of the financial crash of 1857
in the immediately preceding years. In Washington the building of Walter’s new wings
of the Capitol, initiated in 1851,<a id="r214"></a><a href='#f214' class='c025'><sup>[214]</sup></a> and of his cast-iron dome, designed in 1855, continued
until their completion in 1865, right through the war years at President Lincoln’s
express order (Plate <a href='#pl082a'>82<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). There is nothing specifically French about this new work at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the Capitol, even though Walter had the assistance from 1855 of the
Paris-trained Hunt. On the other hand, the original more-or-less
Romantic Classical edifice that had finally been brought to completion
in 1828 by Bulfinch after so many changes of architect was largely
submerged. The new wings echo in their academic porticoes the broader
portico of the original late eighteenth-century design; but the
cast-iron dome (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>), rivalling in size the largest Baroque
domes of Europe, has a high drum and a Michelangelesque silhouette of
the greatest boldness in contrast to the Roman saucer shape of that
designed by Latrobe and not much raised in execution by Bulfinch.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not in Washington that the Second Empire mode was first
introduced for public buildings; Washington, indeed, would never again
be the centre of architectural influence that it was in the Romantic
Classical period, although the new state capitols begun in the sixties
and seventies were mostly capped with imitations of Walter’s dome. A
‘female seminary’ on the Hudson River, endowed by a brewer, and the
new City Hall in Boston, Mass., both dating from the opening of the
sixties, are the first monumental instances of the new mode that
dominated the field of secular public building until the financial
Panic of 1873 brought the post-war boom to a close. James Renwick,<a id="r215"></a><a href='#f215' class='c025'><sup>[215]</sup></a>
who designed the very extensive Main Hall for Matthew Vassar’s new
college at Arlington near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1860, was
specifically instructed by his client to imitate the Tuileries—not the
New Louvre—and so he did in an elaborately pavilioned composition of
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped
plan crowned by various sorts of
high mansards. This overshadows in significance his earlier Charity
Hospital of 1858 on Blackwell’s Island in New York, already mansarded
but very plain, and his Corcoran Gallery of 1859, now the Court of
Claims, in Washington, with a rich but muddled façade still rather
flatly conceived.</p>

<p class='c010'>Renwick was at least as eclectic as such Europeans as Ballu and
Ferstel. Having made his first reputation with the building of the
Anglican Grace Church in New York in 1843-6—if not very Camdenian,
this is at least a fair specimen of revived fourteenth-century English
Gothic—he continued in the Gothic line with the Catholic St Patrick’s
Cathedral in New York, begun in 1859 and completed (except for the
spires) in 1879. That vast two-towered pile, however, is Gothic in a
very Continental way, resembling Gau’s and Ballu’s Sainte-Clotilde in
Paris and Ferstel’s Votivkirche in Vienna more than anything English
of the period. In the late forties Renwick had also been the agent of
Robert Dale Owen’s ‘Romanesque Revival’ aspirations in designing the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>For such things as the Smithsonian and his churches Renwick had plenty of visual
documents on which to lean, either archaeological treatises on the buildings of the
medieval past or illustrations of contemporary foreign work. But for Vassar College,
very evidently, he was dependent for his inspiration on rather generalized lithographic
or engraved views of the Tuileries. Nor could he, at this relatively early date, borrow
much from published illustrations of contemporary English work in the new international
Second Empire mode. The particular plastic vitality of the Americanized
Second Empire is already notable in this early example, however, even though the rather
crude articulation of the red brick walls is remote from anything French of any period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth. Later buildings by Renwick in the same
mode are richer and closer to Parisian standards, but their architectonic vitality is considerably
less.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Boston City Hall,<a id="r216"></a><a href='#f216' class='c025'><sup>[216]</sup></a> built by G. J. F. Bryant (1816-99) and Arthur D. Gilman
(1821-82) in 1862-5, is a smaller but suaver edifice. Although it is a compactly planned
block, the articulation of the walls by successive Roman-arched orders, coldly but competently
executed in stone, is boldly plastic below the crowning mansards. However,
just before this, for the Arlington Street Church of 1859-61, the first edifice erected in
the Back Bay district that Gilman was just laying out,<a id="r217"></a><a href='#f217' class='c025'><sup>[217]</sup></a> he had turned not to France but
to eighteenth-century England for inspiration, basing himself chiefly on the same
churches by Gibbs that had been the most popular American models in later Colonial
times.</p>

<p class='c010'>A leading opponent of the Greek Revival, Gilman, like most Continental architects
of the day, evidently knew better what he meant to leave behind than whither he wished
to proceed. His Boston church initiated no national wave of Gibbsian church architecture;
indeed, the sixties were the heyday of Victorian Gothic design for churches in
the United States. His City Hall, on the other hand, set off a nation-wide programme of
public building in the Second Empire mode; for Boston was now for a score of years
the artistic as well as the intellectual headquarters of the country in succession to Philadelphia.
In this programme municipalities, state authorities, and the Federal Government
all participated actively during the decade following the Civil War. In the case
of many Federal buildings, only nominally the work of the office of the Supervising
Architect, where A. B. Mullet (1834-90) succeeded Rogers in 1865, Gilman acted in
these years as consultant, and was probably the real designer rather than Mullet or his
assistants.</p>

<p class='c010'>These vast monuments were mostly constructed during General Grant’s presidency.
Parisian in intention, yet American in their materials, they are withal rather similar to
Second Empire work in England. Few were completed before the mode went out of
favour as changes in architectural control sometimes make evident. In the case of the
New York State Capitol in Albany, for example, begun in 1868 by Thomas Fuller
(1822-98) and his partner Augustus Laver (1834-98), both arriving from England via
Canada, Eidlitz and Richardson took over jointly in 1875, modifying the design of the
building very notably above the lower storeys towards the Romanesquoid. Thus it was
finally brought to completion by them and others in the following twenty years. The
very tall tower on the Philadelphia City Hall, begun in 1874, was finished over a
decade later. This tower, whose crowning statue of William Penn still tops the local
skyline, has hardly anything in common with the Louvre-like pavilions below; yet the
whole is nominally the work of one architect, John McArthur, Jr (1823-90), the grandfather
of General Douglas McArthur.</p>

<p class='c010'>Undoubtedly the association of these prominent buildings with the unsavoury Grant
administration and the fact that there were—at least in the two cases mentioned above—major
financial scandals involved in their slow and incredibly costly construction played
an important part in the early rejection of a mode so associated with the public vices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>of the decade after the Civil War. Not many of them are extant today other than the
Boston, Albany, and Philadelphia structures just mentioned and the old State Department
Building in Washington (Plate <a href='#pl082b'>82<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In New York, Boston, and other large cities the vast granite piles in this mode that
long served as post offices are all gone. In Chicago the Cook County Buildings built by
J. J. Egan in 1872-5 have also long since been replaced. In San Francisco Fuller &amp; Laver’s
extensive group of Municipal Buildings was destroyed in the fire that followed the
earthquake of 1906. This must have been the largest, the richest, and plastically the most
complex production of the whole lot, with its triangular site, boldly articulated massing,
and central dome.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though threatened by every new administration, the State, War and Navy Department
Building built by Mullet in 1871-5 still stands, overshadowing the nearby
White House. This is perhaps the best extant example in America of the Second Empire—or
as it is sometimes called locally, the ‘General Grant’—mode
(Plate <a href='#pl082b'>82<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The tiers of
Roman-arched orders in fine grey granite, borrowed by Gilman as consultant architect
and presumptive designer from his earlier Boston City Hall rather than from Paris,
tower up storey above storey to carry mansards of various different heights above the
complex pavilioned plan. Cold and grand, almost without sculptural decoration, this
could hardly be less like the New Louvre or the old Tuileries in general texture; nor is
there any of the playful semi-Gothic detail of Knowles’s and Giles’s London hotels or of
the festive colouring and lush ornamentation of Brodrick’s at Scarborough.</p>

<p class='c010'>The contrast of the old State Department Building with its <i>pendant</i> on the other side
of Lafayette Square, Mills’s Grecian Treasury, finally completed by Rogers a decade
earlier, is shocking to most people. Yet it is fascinating to read here the representational
aspirations of an age that found its most significant expression, not in its public buildings,
but in the new skyscrapers which first rose in New York at just this time, Hunt’s
Tribune Building and the Western Union Building by his pupil George B. Post. Both,
incidentally, were heavily mansarded, and the one by the American-trained Post was
much more typically Second Empire than is the French-trained Hunt’s (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In urban domestic architecture, both on large mansions and on the more usual terrace
houses, mansards became characteristic but not ubiquitous in the late fifties and remained
so down to the mid seventies and even later in the West. Boston’s Back Bay
district, laid out by Gilman in 1859, has a few mansions along Commonwealth Avenue
that resemble somewhat the <i>hôtels particuliers</i> of Paris, and also several mansarded
terraces by Bryant &amp; Gilman and other architects in that avenue and in Arlington and
Beacon Streets. The materials used are un-Parisian—brownstone like Gilman’s nearby
church or dark-red brick with brownstone trim—and the detail is rarely very plausibly
French. In general, inspiration still came from London, even if nothing so extensive and
spectacularly monumental as Grosvenor Place and Grosvenor Gardens was ever produced.
In New York Lienau’s finest terrace, that built in Fifth Avenue between 55th and
56th Streets in 1869, was rather more sumptuous than the Boston examples, being of
white marble with very literate ranges of superposed orders. Hunt’s New York work
was often so authentically Parisian as quite to lack the bombast of the international
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Second Empire mode. Especially interesting were his Stuyvesant Flats in 18th Street, New
York, of 1869-70. This block was a very early example of an apartment house of the
Parisian sort in America, where they did not generally flourish much before the
late eighties.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the more characteristic free-standing houses that were built outside cities, in
suburbs, in towns, and even in the country, the Second Empire mode was also very
popular. Interpreted in wood, painted brown or grey stone colours, these have a distinctly
autochthonous character. Generally symmetrical and tightly planned, they did
not advance the development of the American house in the way of the rival ‘Stick
Style’; but in their emphasis on complicated three-dimensional modelling, especially the
modelling of the roofs, they prepared the way for one important aspect of the later and
more original ‘Shingle Style’ (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Second Empire episode in the United States is a curious one. On the one hand, it
was a consciously ‘modern’ movement, deriving its prestige from contemporary Paris,
not from any period of the past like the Greek, the Gothic, or even the Renaissance
Revivals—of which last, of course, it was in some limited sense an heir. On the other
hand, the considerable originality of the mode as it was actually employed was largely
unconscious and due to the lack of accurate visual documents, or even a codified body
of precedent, to be followed. At this time contemporary conditions demanded, as in
Europe, the construction of many public edifices, Federal, state, and municipal, to house
a complexity of functions. It would have been almost impossible to compress these
within the rigid rectangles of the Greek Revival even had the Greek Revival not already
been rejected by most critics twenty years or more earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet the Second Empire episode was necessarily brief, lasting little more than a decade.
The crass assurance it reflected, particularly the special arrogance of the post-war
politicians in Washington, the state capitals, and in the bigger cities, was much shaken
by the Panic of 1873. The mode did not therefore, as in much of Europe, continue in
America into the eighties and nineties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The episode has a longer-term significance, nevertheless. Slight as was the actual
relationship to the Second Empire mode of the first two Americans to be trained at the
École des Beaux Arts, Hunt and Richardson, their personal influence and their prestige
encouraged a growing trek of architectural students to Paris; their recommendations
alone would hardly have had much effect had not fashion already established Paris
rather than London in the public mind as the centre of modern architectural achievement
and inspiration. From the mid eighties on, the long-maintained dependence on
England in architectural matters began to be notably weakened; for a generation and
more very many American architects would seek their roots abroad, but henceforth in
France, or even Italy, not England.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not surprising that in the British Dominions there was no such direct French influence
in this period as in Latin America. Urban entities like the Colmena and its terminal
square in Lima, Peru, pavilioned and mansarded throughout, rival European
examples like the Søtorvet in Copenhagen or the Galerij in Amsterdam. Before they
gave way to skyscrapers, the <i>hôtels particuliers</i> along the Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>City were more numerous and more plausibly Parisian than along Commonwealth
Avenue in Boston or Bellevue Avenue at Newport. But both in Canada and in Australia
the Second Empire mode arrived from England late and in a more corrupted form than
in America. The mansarded Windsor Hotel of 1878 in Montreal hardly rivalled the
Palmer House of 1872 in Chicago by J. M. Van Osdel (1811-91), to which the rich merchant
Potter Palmer was as proud to give his name as to the incredible fake castle that he
built for his own occupancy a decade later. The Princess Theatre in Melbourne, Australia,
built by William Pitt in 1877, with its three square-domed mansards, has an appealing
nonchalance, like that of the contemporary edifices of the mining towns high in the
American Rocky Mountains—the hotel in Virginia City, Nevada, that has been mentioned
earlier, or the much more modest Opera House in Central City, Colorado, for
example. But the public architecture of the third quarter of the century in Australia was
more restrained in design just because it was generally so very retardataire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Parliament House in Melbourne, begun in 1856 by John G. Knight (1824-92)
and completed in 1880 by Peter Kerr (1820-1912), has academic virtues not unworthy
of Kerr’s master Barry, though its giant colonnades recall rather those of Brodrick’s
contemporary Town Hall in Leeds. The Treasury Buildings in Melbourne, by John
James Clark (1838-1915) of 1857-8, are not unworthy of comparison with High
Renaissance work of the period on the Continent. Other public buildings of the sixties
and seventies are of more definitely Victorian character, but Early Victorian rather than
High. For example, Clark’s Government House of 1872-6 in South Melbourne is a
towered Italian Villa consciously modelled on Queen Victoria’s Osborne House of a
generation earlier. Both in Australia and in Canada the Victorian Gothic had more
vitality in this period (see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>There is little profit in pursuing farther in the outlying areas of the western world
evidence of direct influence from Paris (of which there is, for example, some in
Russia) or autochthonous variants of the Second Empire mode. In this generally rather
unrewarding period the best work mostly falls under the High Victorian Gothic rubric,
or else it illustrates specifically the development of commercial and domestic architecture
in the Anglo-American world (see Chapters <a href='#ch18'>10</a> and <a href='#ch11'>11</a>; <a href='#ch14'>14</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).
In an attempt to give an over-all picture too many buildings of low
intrinsic quality and little present-day interest have already been
cited.</p>

<p class='c010'>What makes especially difficult the proper historical assessment of the widespread influence
of Paris in the decades following 1850 is that this influence, whether direct or
indirect, rarely produced buildings on the Continent of real distinction or even of
much vitality. Only in England and the United States, where the mode was quite reshaped
by a different cultural situation and the bold use of local materials, is it of much
independent interest. The more plausibly Parisian the work outside France, the less
vigour it usually possesses. Some of it can be very plausible indeed, as for example the
street architecture of Mexico City and Buenos Aires, even if what appears to be carved
French limestone in the Argentine capital is usually but a triumph of imitative craftsmanship
on the part of stucco-workers imported from Italy. In general, Mexican
and Argentine Second Empire is very dull, as dull as in Belgium, say, with no Poelaerts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>to redress the balance. Yet along the Malecón in Havana, Cuba, where the traditional
galleried house-fronts were reinterpreted in a generically Second Empire way with
Andalusian lushness, the results are much more notable, not least because the soft local
stone has been very richly weathered by the strong sea breeze. As was mentioned
earlier, the use of <i>azulejos</i> in extraordinary tones of brilliant green and purple gives
autochthonous character to similar work in Brazil.</p>

<p class='c010'>The international Second Empire mode has so far found no historian or even a sympathetic
critic. Perhaps no other mode so widespread in its acceptance and so prolific in
its production has ever received so little attention from posterity. Yet beside it the contemporary
stream of the Victorian Gothic mode, which has been recurrently studied,
must seem more than a little parochial and also excessively dependent on the individual
capacities—not to say the caprices—of its leading practitioners. Within the areas in
which the Victorian Gothic was employed, however, an area effectively confined to
the Anglo-Saxon world geographically and to certain kinds of buildings typologically,
it was capable of major architectural achievement. Moreover, thanks to the line of
spiritual descent from the leaders of the generation of architects active in the third
quarter of the century to those of the next, the more creative aspects of the architecture
of the turn of the century derive in not inconsiderable part from the later Victorian
Gothic.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lefuels and Hansens, or such men as Brodrick, Poelaert, and
Gilman, trained no worthy pupils. But the disciples of the Victorian
Gothic leaders not only include such very able young men who actually
worked in their offices as Webb and Shaw and Voysey but also, in some
sense at least, so great an American architect as Richardson, whose
formal training had been wholly Parisian (see Chapters <a href='#ch11'>11</a>,
<a href='#ch12'>12</a>, and <a href='#ch13'>13</a>). The advance of domestic architecture in the
second half of the nineteenth century and, to a somewhat lesser
extent, also that of commercial architecture therefore owed a great
deal to the Victorian Gothic, at least in England and America
(see Chapters <a href='#ch14'>14</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>By</span> 1850 Neo-Gothic was accepted as a proper mode for churches throughout the
western world. Only in England, however, had it become dominant for such use.
Moreover, Gothic was a more than acceptable alternative there to Greek or Renaissance
or Jacobethan design for many other sorts of buildings also. Only in the urban fields of
commercial construction and of terrace-housing was its employment still very rare. On
the Continent the nearest equivalent in popularity and ubiquity to the Victorian Gothic
was the German <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. Neo-Gothic, although used more and more everywhere
after 1850 for churches, attracted few architectural talents of a high order (see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>).</p>
<p class='c010'>There are several reasons why the Gothic Revival was able in England, and almost
only in England, to pass into a new and creative phase around 1850. One was certainly
the ethical emphasis of its doctrines, an emphasis more sympathetic to Victorians than to
most Europeans of this period, but not without its appeal on the Continent towards the
end of the century. Another reason was the informality, not to say the amateurishness,
of architectural education in Britain, encouraging personal discipleship and the cultivation
of individual expression rather than providing for the continuation of an academic
tradition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Related to this is the private character of architectural practice in England as compared
to its more public responsibilities and controls on the Continent. The desirable professional
positions in France, and to almost the same degree in many other European countries,
were those offered by the sovereign or the State. But after the time of Soane and
Nash official employment ceased to carry either prestige or opportunity in England,
the Houses of Parliament notwithstanding—it was not Barry’s work there but his clubs
and mansions that established his high professional reputation. As in the eighteenth century,
a social and aesthetic <i>élite</i> still provided both critical esteem and the most desirable
commissions for Victorian architects; by 1850 a large part of that <i>élite</i> was very church-minded
and thoroughly Gothicized. Not until the mid sixties was there any significant
change; even then those responsible for this change, both the architects and their patrons,
had all been brought up in the churchly Gothic Revival tradition.</p>

<p class='c010'>The High Victorian Gothic opened with the building of a London church. All Saints’,
Margaret Street, designed in 1849, largely completed externally by 1852, and consecrated
in 1859, was the result of no imperial fiat, like the Votivkirche in Vienna or the big
churches of the sixties in Paris, nor did it occupy like them an isolated site approached
by wide new boulevards. Intended as a ‘model’ church by its sponsors, the Ecclesiological
Society, and financed by private individuals, All Saints’ is set in a minor West
End street at the rear of a restricted court flanked by a clergy house
and a school (Plate <a href='#pl006a'>6<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But for its tower, the tallest
feature of the mid-century London skyline, it would have been hard to
find; but once found, it could never be ignored.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>The architect of All Saints’, Butterfield, had been for some years, together with Carpenter,
the favourite of the ecclesiologists because of the Pugin-like ‘correctness’ of his
revived fourteenth-century English Gothic. Now, quite suddenly, he and his sponsors
embarked on new paths. As soon as the walls began to rise, their startling character became
apparent; for the church is of red brick, a material long out of use in London, and
that red brick is banded and patterned with black brick, a theme varied on the tower by
the insertion of broad bands of stone. ‘Permanent polychrome’, achieved with a variety
of materials, thus made its debut here. In the interior, moreover, the polychromatic effect
was even richer and more strident, with marquetry of marble and tile in the spandrels of
the nave arcade and over the chancel arch, not to speak of onyx and gilding in the
chancel itself (Plate <a href='#pl085'>85</a>). The very exiguous site forced any expansion upwards; the
nave is tall, the vaulted chancel taller, and the subsidiary structures flanking the court
are even higher and narrower in their proportions.</p>

<p class='c010'>While the construction of All Saints’ proceeded there was much concurrent and complementary
activity in the English architectural world. In 1849 a young critic, John
Ruskin (1819-1900), had brought out an influential book, <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i>,
in which many of the recommendations ran parallel to, if indeed they did not influence,
Butterfield’s latest stylistic innovations. Notably, Ruskin urged the study of
Italian Gothic: if All Saints’ is, in fact, not specifically Italian in the character of its polychromy,
it seemed so to most contemporaries. The real foreign influences here, as in the
profile of the fine plain steeple, are German if anything. Butterfield’s moulded detail
continued to follow quite closely English fourteenth-century models.<a id="r218"></a><a href='#f218' class='c025'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In this same year 1849 Wild<a id="r219"></a><a href='#f219' class='c025'><sup>[219]</sup></a> was building on an even more obscure London site
in Soho his St Martin’s Northern Schools with pointed arcades of brick definitely
derived from Italian models. Moreover, he was being acclaimed for doing this by the
very ecclesiological leaders who had ten years before condemned his Christ Church,
Streatham, as ‘Saracenic’. With the publication of the first volume of Ruskin’s next
book, <i>The Stones of Venice</i>, in 1851 (the two less important later volumes came out in
1853) and the appearance of <i>Brick and Marble Architecture of the Middle Ages in Italy</i> by
G. E. Street (1824-81) in 1855, Italian influence increased. Street’s name, moreover,
introduces the third of the three men most responsible for the sharp turn that English
architecture was taking in the fifties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without depending on polychromy, Butterfield designed in 1850 and built in 1851-2
St Matthias’s off Howard Road in Stoke Newington, a London suburb, another church
of novel character. Unconfined by a closed-in urban site, this also showed in its great
scale and the bold silhouette of the gable-roofed tower—still standing today above
the bombed ruin of the church—how the timid Early Victorian Gothic of the forties
could be invigorated. Moreover, at St Bartholomew’s at Yealmpton in Devonshire, built
in 1850, Butterfield introduced in a country church striped piers of two different tones
of marble and considerable coloured marquetry work. A former fellow assistant of
Street in G. G. Scott’s office, William H. White (1826-90), at All Saints’ in Talbot Road,
Kensington, in London, begun in 1850, also used the new polychromy that soon
became the principal, though by no means the only, hallmark of High Victorian Gothic.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>A large country house of stone by S. S. Teulon (1812-73), Tortworth Court in
Gloucestershire, built in 1849-53, has no polychromy, although its architect was soon to
be the most unrestrained of all in its exploitation. His patrons, moreover, would be
notably ‘lower’ in their churchmanship than the members of the Ecclesiological Society
who employed Butterfield. But in the boldly plastic massing of Tortworth, leading up
to a tall central tower of the most complex silhouette, Teulon exemplified the new architectural
ambitions, ambitions that would soon be finding as striking expression in
secular work as in ecclesiastical building whether ‘high’ or ‘low’.</p>

<p class='c010'>Street had been a favourite of the High Church party since he first began building
small churches and schools of a most ‘correct’ sort in Cornwall on leaving Scott’s office.<a id="r220"></a><a href='#f220' class='c025'><sup>[220]</sup></a>
He was also the author of several critical articles published in <i>The Ecclesiologist</i>, notable
for their cogency. In these he commented, for example, on the applicability of the arcades
of Wild’s school to commercial building; he also attacked the curious habit of the
forties, most prevalent with the ecclesiologists, of designing urban churches on confined
sites as if they were to sprawl over ample village greens. Street began his first important
church with associated school buildings, All Saints’, Boyn Hill, at Maidenhead, in
1853. Here he employed red brick and almost as much permanent polychrome as
Butterfield at All Saints’, Margaret Street. He also handled the detail, particularly on the
schools, with something of the same sort of brutal ‘realism’ (to use the catchword of
the period) that Butterfield used on his subsidiary buildings.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the same year in London Street’s former employer Scott, long established as the
most successful, if hardly the most ‘correct’, of Early Victorian Gothic practitioners,
and since 1849 Architect to Westminster Abbey, built in Broad Sanctuary contiguous
to the façade of the Abbey a Gothic terrace. That the use of Gothic should have been
encouraged here by the Abbey authorities is not surprising. But they themselves may
well have been surprised at what their architect produced; for this is no flat range of
Neo-Tudor fronts in stock brick, but a plastic mass of stonework bristling with oriels
and turrets and capped with a broken skyline of stepped gables. Nothing here recalls the
rather French thirteenth-century Gothic of the Abbey itself; instead the effect is Germanic,
recalling the medieval houses of the Hansa cities. The work was executed with a
boldness of detail doubtless less personal in character than Butterfield’s or Street’s, but
quite as striking to the casual observer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Scott’s houses had little influence, however. Gothic terraces were no more popular in
the fifties and sixties in England than in the preceding decades. In residential districts the
flood of more-or-less Renaissance stucco continued to spread, little affected by the High
Victorian Gothic. As we have seen, the Second Empire mode also had only a very
limited success in this field of construction, a field dominated not by architects but by
builders.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1853 also Scott provided for the Camden Church in the Peckham Road in South
London—Ruskin’s own family church—a new east end in a round-arched and banded
medievalizing mode; Ruskin himself collaborated on the window design, or so it is said.
There is sufficient Gothic ‘realism’ in the detail here to justify considering this a round-arched
variant of the High Victorian Gothic; but it is definitely of Italian inspiration.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>It seems also to be related to the later <i>Rundbogenstil</i> of this decade in Germany and
Austria; nor is it altogether without resemblance to such a contemporary French church
as Vaudoyer’s Byzantinesque cathedral of Marseilles.</p>

<p class='c010'>Several far more important and better publicized interventions in architecture on the
part of Ruskin followed immediately. In considerable part because of his personal influence
with Oxford friends, the Gothic design of the Irish architects Sir Thomas Deane<a id="r221"></a><a href='#f221' class='c025'><sup>[221]</sup></a>
(1792-1871) and Benjamin Woodward (1815-61) was accepted for the University
Museum at Oxford in 1855. Woodward had already proved himself a would-be Ruskinian
in detailing their design of 1853 for the Museum of Trinity College, Dublin, in
a Venetian (though largely <i>quattrocento</i>) way. As the Oxford Museum rose to completion
in the next four years, Ruskin was in continuous contact with Woodward, providing
himself the design for at least one window as well as encouraging the delegation to the
Irish carvers of much of the responsibility for the ornamental decoration—of which
only a small part was, in fact, ever executed. The work of the O’Sheas is better
appreciated in Dublin, where the decoration both of the Trinity College building and
of the Kildare Street Club of 1861 was carried out by them in a very free and yet boldly
naturalistic vein.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most interesting feature of the University Museum—and one that it is surprising
to find Ruskin, who hated iron and all it stood for in the nineteenth-century world, involved
with—is the court, with its roof of iron and glass (Plate <a href='#pl086b'>86<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). How different this is,
however, from what iron-founders without architectural control were providing at the
same time in the Brompton Boilers! Yet it is even more different from Hopper’s or
Rickman’s iron Gothic of fifty years earlier (Plate <a href='#pl060b'>60<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). For all the elaboration of the
ornament, which is very metallic in character but also very aware of Early Gothic
precedent, what is most notable is the highly articulated character of the structure, as if
the architects had asked themselves: ‘How would medieval builders have used structural
iron had it been readily available to them?’ Is this, perhaps, the first echo in England of
the theories of Viollet-le-Duc, the French architect who was to exercise an international
influence equal to Ruskin’s over the next generation? Probably not, as his own enthusiasm
for iron began only rather later (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). Whether or not there is specific
influence from Viollet-le-Duc here, his great archaeological publication, the <i>Dictionnaire
raisonné</i>,<a id="r222"></a><a href='#f222' class='c025'><sup>[222]</sup></a> had begun to appear the year before. Very soon the structural expressiveness
of ‘Early French’ detailing, studied by English architects at first hand as well as in
the woodcuts of the <i>Dictionnaire</i>, began to supplant Italian polychromy as the hallmark
of advanced fashion in the higher aesthetic circles.</p>

<p class='c010'>A more modest Oxford building by Deane &amp; Woodward, the Union Debating Hall
of 1856-7, has more vigour on the whole than does the Museum, particularly in its characteristically
notched brick detailing. It also has the advantage of murals by the young
Pre-Raphaelites. One of these, who had just left Street’s architectural office to turn
briefly to painting, was William Morris (1834-96).<a id="r223"></a><a href='#f223' class='c025'><sup>[223]</sup></a> His ceiling here initiated the most
distinguished career of architectural decoration of the second half of the century. Morris
as a critical writer was destined, moreover, to be at least as influential on later architecture
as Ruskin or Viollet-le-Duc.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Of the same date, 1856, is perhaps the most successful of Butterfield’s extant churches,
that at Baldersby St James near Beverley in Yorkshire, with its contiguous group of
vicarage, schools, and cottages. All of stone externally, the polychromy here is rather a
sort of ‘poly-texture’ most effectively handled in the banding of the tall pyramidal spire
above the plain square tower (Plate <a href='#pl087'>87</a>). Internally a delicate harmony of pink and
grey-blue bricks, with accents of creamy stone, replaces the acid chords of All Saints’ in
London, a harmony rivalled in the Welsh church of St Augustine’s at Penarth near Cardiff
built a decade later in 1866. At the same time, Teulon at St Andrew’s in Coin Street
off Stamford Street south of the Thames in London was using the boldest of brick-and-stone
banding externally and, inside, elaborate patterns of light-coloured brickwork.
Moreover, the rather Germanic planning of this church, demolished since the Second
World War, was highly unorthodox by ecclesiological standards. Already it was evident
that within the High Victorian Gothic there were to be two streams, one High Church
in its patronage and led by architects of considerable learning and sophistication like
Butterfield and Street, another more characteristically Low Church and often quite
secular; this was generally coarser and more philistine, not to say outright illiterate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet not all the best work of the High Church architects was ecclesiastical. By 1857
J. L. Pearson (1817-97) had already built some respectable if not very interesting
churches distinguished chiefly by their very fine spires; but his first work of positive
High Victorian character was Quar Wood, a country house he built in Gloucestershire
in that year. The skilful asymmetrical massing around the stair tower here, the
plastic variety provided by several different types of steep roofs, the crisp precision of
the detailing, all combine to produce a modest mansion that is as different in effect from
Teulon’s mountainous Tortworth as both are characteristic of the beginnings of the
High Victorian Gothic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two houses begun soon after Quar Wood, both within the broad frame of reference
of the maturing High Victorian Gothic, could hardly differ more from one another. In
remodelling Eatington Park in Warwickshire in 1858 John Prichard (1818-86) attempted
to mask an underlying Georgian mansion with a profusion of bold innovations
in the detailing. Stone polychromy, applied sculpture, bold plastic membering of wall,
roof, and chimneys, all are used here more abundantly than ever before. The Red House
at Bexley Heath in Kent, on the other hand, which Philip Webb (1831-1915), who had
been a fellow pupil with Morris in Street’s office, built for Morris in 1859-60, is notable
for its extreme simplicity. So also is the house now known as Benfleet Hall that he
built in 1861 at Cobham in Surrey for Spencer Stanhope, another of the young artists
who had collaborated on the murals of the Oxford Union. This has a rather better
plan than the Red House.</p>

<p class='c010'>These houses have no external polychromy, only plain red brick beautifully laid;
there is no sculptured detail at all; and the few breaks in the loose massing of the walls
and roof are closely related to the informal ease of the rather novel plans. Only the high
roofs of red tile are similar to those of Pearson’s Quar Wood. But in the plain, very
‘real’, detailing and the segmental-headed white-painted window-sash of an early
eighteenth-century sort, set under pointed relieving arches, the relationship is close to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the secular work of somewhat older men—to Butterfield’s vicarages of
the forties (Plate <a href='#pl122b'>122<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) and more notably to his clergy house
and school at All Saints’, Margaret Street (Plate <a href='#pl086a'>86<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
Webb had himself worked on some of the latest
of the rather similar vicarages and schools that Street had been
building for a decade. His first big country house, Arisaig, built of
local stone in the remote Scottish Highlands forty miles beyond Fort
William in Inverness-shire beginning in 1863, may properly be
considered High Victorian Gothic also (Figure <a href='#i260'>23</a>). It is especially
interesting, like Benfleet Hall, for its plan (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Down to about 1860 the development of the High Victorian Gothic was on the
whole convergent. Henceforth, ambitious young architects tried harder to have personal
modes of their own like Butterfield; yet, conversely, many formed loose stylistic alliances
in which individual expression became merged in some sort of group expression.
The boldest and the most unruly were no longer likely to be of the High Church party,
but rather of the Low. St Simon Zelotes of 1859 in Moore Street in London by Joseph
Peacock (1821-93) hardly compares with the work of Butterfield and Street in distinction;
but its internal polychromy of white and black brick outbids that of their best
London churches, also built at the end of this decade.</p>

<p class='c010'>Butterfield’s St Alban’s in Baldwin’s Gardens off Holborn in London, erected 1858-61,
is all rebuilt now. But something of its splendidly tall proportions, if not the rich brick
and tile marquetry of the wall over the chancel arch, can still be apprehended. The
contrast in quality with Peacock’s work was once amazing. Street’s St James the Less
in Thorndike Street off the Vauxhall Bridge Road in London also of 1858-61, is less
fine but still much superior to Peacock’s work (Plate <a href='#pl094b'>94<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The tall square tower, set
apart like a campanile, has a curiously gawky roof based on French models and the
interior is somewhat cavernous. But in the richness of its red and black brick patterns,
used both inside and out, and in the naturalistic carving of the nave capitals this church
of Street’s rivals Butterfield’s All Saints’ and St Alban’s and is, unlike the latter, still
completely intact.</p>

<p class='c010'>Various younger men of Webb’s generation were beginning to make important
contributions in church design also. G. F. Bodley (1827-1907), trained in his kinsman
Scott’s office rather than in Street’s, built St Michael’s, Brighton, in 1859-62. This must
have been very striking for the boldness of its scale and for the vigour of its structural
expression before it was overshadowed by the tall later nave beside it added by William
Burges (1827-81).<a id="r224"></a><a href='#f224' class='c025'><sup>[224]</sup></a> But it is not the parody of ‘Early French’ detailing in the square
archivolts and spreading capitals of the nave arcade, so soon to be abjured by Bodley,
that is significant here but the fact that this was the first church to receive an over-all
decorative treatment, including stained glass, at the hands of Morris and his associates,
who included the painters Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is still finer glass of this period designed by Burne-Jones in the east window of
Waltham Abbey in Essex, where the rear wall was rebuilt in the heaviest ‘Early
French’ taste by Burges in 1860-1. As a painter Burne-Jones is hardly to be compared
with Ingres; yet as a designer of stained glass the superiority of such early windows of
his as these at Waltham Abbey to the ones by Ingres at Dreux and at Neuilly is amazing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>It is not the least claim to distinction of the High Victorian Gothic that it nurtured this
brilliant revival of decorative art led by Morris. Many churches of the sixties and
seventies are worth visiting solely for their windows by Morris, Brown, and Burne-Jones
to which there are apparently no worthy Continental parallels.</p>

<p class='c010'>A quite different sort of contemporary church is White’s Holy Saviour, Aberdeen
Park, in London, of 1859. Externally this is quiet and rather shapeless; but inside the red
brick of the exterior gives way to a subtle harmony of patterned brickwork in beiges,
browns, and mauves—assisted in the chancel by some additional decorative painting—that
is unequalled in High Victorian polychromy. Also rather different from standard
High Church Anglican work of the day is the Catholic church of St Peter in Leamington
of 1861-5 (Plate <a href='#pl089a'>89<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) by Henry Clutton (1819-93). He had won the competition for
Lille Cathedral in France in 1855 with a design prepared in collaboration with Burges,
but was not allowed to supervise the construction because he was a Protestant; English
Roman Catholics were not so bigoted. Internally the characteristic articulation of
Puginian planning was given up; nave and apse form one continuous vessel, almost
basilican in effect, under a barrel roof that ends in a half dome. Unfortunately, the
painted decoration of the walls and the ceiling here has all been destroyed; the effect
must once have been much less barren than it is today. Externally, plain red brick is
most happily combined with stone trim treated with great simplicity and yet with extreme
subtlety. The inspiration is Early French, perhaps influenced by Viollet-le-Duc,<a id="r225"></a><a href='#f225' class='c025'><sup>[225]</sup></a>
although Clutton knew old French work at first hand; but the smooth concavities and
the delicately varied chamfers are handled with the greatest originality and justness of
scaling. The fine tower, at once sturdy in its detailing and svelte in its shape, has lost the
original pyramidal roof.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not unworthy of the church, and vastly superior to Clutton’s rather dull country
houses, is the contiguous rectory here, a rectangle in plan with the long gable broken
only by elegantly chamfered pairs of brick chimneys (Plate <a href='#pl089a'>89<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The expanses of plain
brick wall are regularly but not symmetrically pierced by coupled windows divided by
colonnette mullions of stone. In simplicity of massing this rectory surpassed the Red
House and Webb’s other—and in some ways better—early house for Spencer Stanhope,
Benfleet Hall. In their simple dignity such things contrast sharply with the more ambitious
secular work of the day, by this time reaching peaks of elaboration almost
exceeding Prichard’s Eatington Park.</p>

<p class='c010'>Teulon’s Elvethan Park in Hampshire of 1861, for example, is perhaps the wildest
of all High Victorian Gothic houses; this mansion is so complex in composition and
so varied in its detailing that it quite defies description. Polychromy runs riot, forms
of the most various but undefinable Gothic provenience merge into one another, and
the result seems almost to illustrate that original mode of design which Thomas Harris
(1830-1900)<a id="r226"></a><a href='#f226' class='c025'><sup>[226]</sup></a> had just christened ‘Victorian’ in describing a project he published in
1860 for a terrace of houses at Harrow.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, several churches of the mid sixties rivalled Elvethan Hall, if not Harris’s
‘Victorian Terrace’. There was, for example, Teulon’s own St Thomas’s, Wrotham Road,
of 1864, piling up to its heavy central tower among the railway yards of Camden Town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>in London; and there was also his much more peculiar St Paul’s, Avenue Road, also of
1864, in the approaches to Hampstead. This was purged early of its original internal decoration
but it long remained externally an almost unrecognizable variant of the standard
Victorian Gothic church. Both have been demolished since the war. At St Mary’s in
the London suburb of Ealing, built in 1866-73, Teulon used iron columns for the nave
arcade; a still wilder Low Church architect, Bassett Keeling (1836-86), did the same in
two London churches, St Mark’s in St Mark’s Road, Notting Dale, and St George’s on
Campden Hill (where they have since been replaced), both begun in 1864. Nor were
Teulon and Keeling by any means the only architects to revive the use of iron columns
in the sixties; even Burges introduced them once in a church, St Faith’s at Stoke Newington,
now largely demolished, and also in his Speech Room at Harrow School of
1872.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of a quite different order is another London church, St Martin’s in Vicars Road,
Gospel Oak, also begun in 1864. This is by E. B. Lamb (1805-69), an architect who had
already begun to show rather High Victorian tendencies in the thirties. There is no polychromy
here, and the inspiration from the past is neither Italian nor French but the still
heterodox English Perpendicular. The massive plasticity of Lamb’s personal mode, with
much large-scale chamfering and a consistent use of segmental-pointed arches in several
orders, is happier where it was exploited more simply on the nearby rectory. The interior
of his church, which has a sort of central plan with wide transepts and only a
slightly prolonged nave, is a forest of timber-work ingeniously bracketed and intersected
in a fashion peculiar to Lamb. Only perhaps in an international context, in relation to
the contemporary American ‘Stick Style’, is this sort of structural articulation intelligible
(see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). But the solid, compactly planned, and simply detailed rectory has
virtues not unworthy of comparison with Clutton’s at Leamington, if not perhaps with
Webb’s more delicately scaled and functionally articulated early houses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two churches by Street, St John’s at Torquay of 1861-71<a id="r227"></a><a href='#f227' class='c025'><sup>[227]</sup></a> and St Philip and St
James’s at Oxford, which was completed in 1862, are more standard products of the
early sixties. The former is notable for the very rich marble polychromy in the chancel
and the full complement of windows by Morris and Burne-Jones; the latter is more
‘Early French’ with a tall tower rising in front of the polygonal apse and a curiously
unorthodox but effectively ‘real’ way of running the nave arches into the east wall with
no imposts at all. This device was repeated at All Saints’, Clifton, now a ruin, where the
variety of colours of the fine local stones—orange and blue Pennant and cream Bath—permitted
a more truly structural polychromy than usual and one of remarkable tonal
harmony and elegance. All Saints’ was begun in 1863.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both Burges and Pearson erected distinguished churches at this time, Burges in Ireland,
Pearson in London. St Finbar’s Church of Ireland Cathedral in Cork, designed in
1863 for a competition and built in 1865-76, is of unusual size for a British church of
this period and, what is more unusual for a nineteenth-century cathedral, it was completed
without serious modification of the original project. Provided with a fine open
site and a full complement of towers, two flanking the west front and a taller one over
the crossing, this rivals in elaboration the big Continental Gothic churches of the period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>(see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>). Moreover, the detailing is of a distinctly French twelfth-century order
with very few eclectic or Italianate touches, thus recalling the winning design for Lille
Cathedral that he had prepared with Clutton in 1855. Yet the contrast with contemporary
Continental Gothic—especially with Lille Cathedral as finally executed by
others—is almost as great as in the case of the rather more original English churches of
this period by Butterfield or Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the interior of St Finbar’s Burges developed the theme of articulation, a theme
more characteristically Early English than ‘Early French’, with remarkable plastic
vigour, while the handsome wooden roof, so rare a feature in medieval France, lends to
the whole an unmistakably Victorian air. Less subtle, less aesthetic, than other churches
of the sixties by younger men, St Finbar’s has the sort of athletic strength that is characteristic
of much High Victorian Gothic, expressed in unusually literate, not to say
archaeological, terms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burges’s church opened the road again towards a more ‘correct’ imitation of the
medieval High Gothic, a road along which Pearson soon proceeded more rapidly and
more doggedly than he. Yet Pearson’s own South London church of 1863-5, St Peter’s
in Kennington Lane, Vauxhall, is more typically High Victorian than St Finbar’s. The
carved capitals and the heavy scale of the stone detail are rather ‘Early French’. But
walls and vaults are of London stock brick and there is some polychromy of the quieter,
less Butterfieldian, sort resembling a little White’s at St Saviour’s. The continuity of
the chancel and rounded apse with the nave echoes the ‘unified space’ of Clutton’s
Leamington interior. Puginian articulation of plan and mass was henceforth somewhat
out of date.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Albert Memorial<a id="r228"></a><a href='#f228' class='c025'><sup>[228]</sup></a> in Hyde Park in London is a monument generally—and not
unjustly—considered the perfect symbol of this High Victorian period, more perfect
than the Houses of Parliament (in the early sixties at last approaching completion) were
of the previous Early Victorian period. In 1861 Queen Victoria’s beloved husband, the
Prince Consort, died. In the competition for a national memorial to rise in Hyde Park
near the site of the Crystal Palace, held the next year, G. G. Scott almost inevitably won
first place. Construction of the Albert Memorial began in 1863 and took nearly ten
years. By the time it was completed in 1872 critics of advanced taste were already condemning
it, yet it represents precisely what Scott most liked to do and what he undoubtedly
did best—in his own words, this his ‘most prominent work’ represented his
‘highest and most enthusiastic efforts’. It is, moreover, an epitome of the aspirations<a id="r229"></a><a href='#f229' class='c025'><sup>[229]</sup></a>
that were most widely held when it was designed (Plate <a href='#pl090'>90</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The contrast between this elaborate shrine and Scott’s modest and essentially archaeological
Martyrs’ Memorial of 1841 at Oxford is very great—what a long distance the
English Gothic Revival had travelled in a score of years! Among Early Victorian
memorials the Prince Consort’s cenotaph is rather more like Kemp’s Scott Monument
in Edinburgh (Plate <a href='#pl051'>51</a>) than like the Oxford one. But where Kemp’s is soft
and monochrome, this is hard and almost kaleidoscopically polychromatic. Scott’s
theme is still that of the fourteenth-century English Eleanor Crosses, as is certainly
appropriate for a monument to a Royal spouse; but the inspiration came in the main
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>from relatively small reliquaries and other medieval works executed in metal and
embellished with enamels and semi-precious stones.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Martyrs’ Memorial was purely English, the specific precedents for the Albert
Memorial mostly Continental: Italian, French, German, and Flemish. The materials
are cold and shining, polished granites, marbles, and serpentines of various colours;
and much of the detail is executed in gun-metal left plain or gilded. A profusion of
white marble sculpture at various scales leads up to the seated bronze figure of the
Prince by J. H. Foley, finally installed in 1876, over which is a vaulted canopy of brilliantly
coloured glass mosaic. Enamels, cabochons of marble or serpentine, and intricately
crisp detail of the most metallic character carry out Scott’s basic idea of a ciborium
enlarged, like Bernini’s in St Peter’s, to fully architectural scale.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beside the Albert Memorial most of Scott’s other work of this period lacks interest.
His churches, particularly, are likely to be dull and respectable, reflecting the new
eclectic tastes of the day only in a rather inconspicuous way. His Exeter College Chapel
at Oxford of 1856-8 is a sort of Sainte-Chapelle; St John’s College Chapel at Cambridge
of 1863-9 is equally monumental but somewhat less French in character and also more
original in its proportions. His secular work at Oxford and Cambridge is also dull, lacking
the Ruskinian touches that give a certain vitality to the Meadow Buildings built for
Christ Church in 1863 by Sir Thomas Deane and his son Thomas Newenham Deane
(1828-99).</p>

<p class='c010'>Far finer, however, is their Kildare Street Club in Dublin, facing the Trinity College
Museum across an expanse of lawn; for this continues the best Ruskinian tradition of the
work that they did earlier with Woodward.<a id="r230"></a><a href='#f230' class='c025'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>A very striking example of the Gothic of the early sixties in England, superior to anything
at Oxford or Cambridge, is the Merchant Seamen’s Orphan Asylum of 1861 by
G. Somers Clark (1825-82), now the Wanstead Hospital, in a suburb north-east of
London. This is actually more what is supposed to be ‘Ruskinian’, because of its Venetian
detailing, than the very original Dublin clubhouse with its consistent theme of segmental
arches and its bold naturalistic carving; but, like that, the Wanstead building is
generically High Victorian in the asymmetrical massing, the strong colours of the black-banded
red brickwork, and the surprising richness of the decoration Clark lavished on a
utilitarian structure.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the early sixties several younger men, most of them trained in Street’s office, were
already turning away from the stridency of the work of the High Victorian leaders towards
a simpler and suaver mode. Webb’s houses of this period have been mentioned,
and will be again (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). Here the plain row of small London shops that he
built at 91-101 Worship Street, Finsbury, in 1861 might be described. In them the
material is not even red brick, but London stocks excellently laid. Almost nothing is
overtly Gothic, yet a sense of medieval craftsmanship controls the handling of both the
wide shop-windows below and the sash-windows in the upper storeys. Above all, the
general composition is quiet and regular, more like Clutton’s Leamington rectory than
the asymmetrical articulation that is characteristic of Webb’s own houses of these years.</p>

<p class='c010'>A similar quietness controls the design of the wing that W. Eden Nesfield (1835-88),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>son of Barry’s collaborator on Italian gardens, William A. Nesfield (1793-1881), and a
pupil not of Street but of Burn and Salvin, was adding to the Earl of Craven’s seat,
Combe Abbey in Warwickshire, beginning in 1863. This was Nesfield’s earliest work.
Despite his own studies of French Gothic,<a id="r231"></a><a href='#f231' class='c025'><sup>[231]</sup></a> which he had published the previous year
with a dedication to Lord Craven, and the tracings he is supposed to have made from
the illustrations of Gothic detail in Viollet-le-Duc’s <i>Dictionnaire</i>, the arches at Combe
Abbey are round, not pointed, and the major architectural theme is the English late
medieval ‘window-wall’ of many lights divided by stone mullions and transoms.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a completely new house, Cloverley Hall, that Nesfield began in 1865 together
with his partner Richard Norman Shaw (1831-1912), the great window-bays and the
other ranges of stone-mullioned windows in the beautifully laid salmon-pink brick
walls were even more the principal theme of the design. But in the decorations, delicate
in scale and elegant in craftsmanship, a new sort of eclecticism made its appearance.
Basically the house derives from those manor houses of the sixteenth century that were
uninfluenced by Renaissance ideas; but in the detailing of Cloverley there were Japanese
motifs, notably the sunflower disks that Nesfield called his ‘pies’, reflecting the new
interest in oriental art that such painters as Whistler and Rossetti were taking. Except for
its relatively early date, Cloverley Hall has no place in a discussion of High Victorian
Gothic, for it is characteristically Late Victorian (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Nesfield’s partner Shaw, however, built in the sixties two churches that were still
High Victorian in style, one in Yorkshire, the other at Lyons in France. Holy Trinity at
Bingley of 1866-7 is one of the finest examples of the ‘Early French’ phase of the Victorian
Gothic (Plate <a href='#pl094a'>94<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Externally it builds up to a very tall central tower, superbly
proportioned and very simply detailed, that more than rivals in quality Street’s at Oxford.
Internally the fine random-ashlar stonework—there is no polychromy—the very
bold and structural detailing of the square archivolts and the simply carved capitals
illustrate even better than does Webb’s domestic work in brick the new and more
sophisticated attitude towards the building crafts. The principles involved go back to
Pugin; but now for the first time in Webb’s and Nesfield’s and Shaw’s work of the sixties
one senses a real respect, at once intelligent and intuitive, for the differing nature of
different materials. Such a respect would continue to give special virtue to the work of
the most distinguished English and American architects of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries
(see Chapters <a href='#ch12'>12</a>, <a href='#ch13'>13</a>, <a href='#ch15'>15</a>, and <a href='#ch19'>19</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lyons church, which Shaw began in 1868, is perhaps the finest of the many
Victorian churches built on the Continent for local English colonies, but very different
indeed from that at Bingley. A city church set between tall blocks of flats, this is also
very tall in its proportions and has a more urban character than that of the Yorkshire
church. French freestone does not lend itself to the particular type of semi-rustic craftsmanship
that was now rising to favour with the younger English architects; hence the
Lyons church is less significant than the Bingley one in that respect. But Shaw was not
primarily a church architect, nor did he long remain a High Victorian (see Chapter <a href='#ch12'>12</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>More characteristic of the various new directions that the Victorian Gothic was taking
in the mid sixties, directions that soon also led quite away from the High Victorian, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>two new churches both designed well before Shaw’s at Bingley and Lyons were begun.
At All Saints’ in Jesus Lane, Cambridge, begun in 1863, the spikiness of the Italianizing
Victorian Gothic and the rugged structuralism of the ‘Early French’—rarely carried
farther than in Bodley’s own early work—gave way to something much more English
in inspiration. There is, for example, a very deep chancel and only one aisle, not to speak
of a battlemented tower at one side, out of which rises a small stone spire. In fact, Bodley
returned here to the fourteenth-century Decorated models preferred by Pugin, some so
‘late’ as to suggest the still forbidden Perpendicular.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bodley now made even more use of the decorative talents of Morris and his associates
than at St Michael’s, Brighton. His St Martin’s-on-the-Cliff, Scarborough, completed
in 1863, is a finer church than either St Michael’s or All Saints’. Falling between them
in style as well as in date, this has less historical importance, but it also was richly decorated
by the Morris firm. At All Saints’ painted polychromy, but of a rather subtle order much
superior to most of that of the forties, entirely replaced permanent polychrome. The
brocade patterns stencilled on the walls seem almost to be designs of Pugin strengthened
in their outlines and their colours by Morris. Although Bodley’s mature career as one
of the two principal Late Victorian church architects did not really get under way until
1870, Victorian Gothic was evidently coming full circle at All Saints’, and the High
Victorian phase was nearly over.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other important new church of this period, St Saviour’s, Penn Street, in the Hoxton
district of the East End of London, was begun in 1865 by James Brooks (1825-1901).
Unfortunately this was very badly damaged in the blitz, and has since been
demolished. St Saviour’s was of brick and included some polychromy like Brooks’s
slightly earlier East End church, St Michael’s in Mark Street, Shoreditch, of 1863-5. But
what was really significant at St Saviour’s was the unified interior space, ending like
Clutton’s Leamington church and Pearson’s Vauxhall church in London in a rounded
apse (Plate <a href='#pl089b'>89<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Notable also were the Webb-like quietness of the general composition
and the straightforward handling of the main structural elements. In another, happily
unblitzed, church by Brooks in the East End of London, St Chad’s, Nichols Square, in
Haggerston, which was begun in 1867, the same qualities can be seen in a more mature
state. Moreover, the rather plain windows and the simple moulded brick trim are
echoed at domestic scale on the nearby rectory.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fine vessel of the interior of St Chad’s, with its simple nave arcade of stone, clean
red-brick walls, quietly structural wooden roof over the nave, and brick-vaulted chancel,
contrasts strikingly with the hectic elaboration and dramatically vertical proportions
of Butterfield’s last London church of any great interest, St Augustine’s, Queen’s Gate,
of 1865-71. Two churches of the late sixties outside London, All Saints’ at Babbacombe
near Torquay, which was built in 1868-74, and the earlier mentioned St Augustine’s at
Penarth, begun in 1866, are much more satisfactory examples of Butterfield’s middle
period.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brooks continued through the seventies to develop the implications of his East End
churches with great success. The largest and most notable is that of the Ascension,
Lavender Hill, in Battersea, which was begun in 1873 and completed by J. T. Micklethwaite<a id="r232"></a><a href='#f232' class='c025'><sup>[232]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>(1843-1906), a former assistant of G. G. Scott, in 1883. The vast lancet-pierced
red-brick hull of this church is one of the landmarks of the South London
skyline; the interior, which is perhaps a little bare, has nevertheless a monumentality
of scale rare in English churches of any period. However, this monumentality is rivalled
both inside and out in St Bartholomew’s, Brighton (Plate <a href='#pl093b'>93<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), completed in 1875 by
Edmund E. Scott (?-1895), and considerably later in Brooks’s own London church of
All Hallows, Shirlock Street, begun in 1889 and never provided with its intended vaults.</p>

<p class='c010'>Victorian Gothic, whether Early or High, is primarily an ecclesiastical mode. The
leading Neo-Gothic architects were happiest when building churches; their few secular
works—if parsonages, colleges, and schools can really in this period be called secular—generally
have a churchy tone. But it is characteristic of the High Victorian Gothic as
opposed to the Early Victorian Gothic, and <i>a fortiori</i> to Neo-Gothic on the Continent,
that it became for some twenty years, from the early fifties to the early seventies, a
nearly universal mode.<a id="r233"></a><a href='#f233' class='c025'><sup>[233]</sup></a> A good many houses have already been cited; and certainly no
churches of this period provide finer specimens of High Victorian Gothic than the warehouse
at 104 Stokes Croft in Bristol, which was built by E. W. Godwin (1833-86), a
friend of Burges, in the early sixties (Plate <a href='#pl113'>113</a>), or the office building of 1864-5 at 60
Mark Lane in London by George Aitchison (1825-1910). The one is an especially subtly
polychromed attempt to follow Ruskin’s Italianism, the other more ‘Early French’ in
its detail, but both use round-arched arcading throughout their several storeys (see
Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Godwin in two rather modest town halls, one at Northampton of 1861-4, which is
very rich in sculptural detail, the other at Congleton, Cheshire, of 1864-7, which is more
severe and ‘Early French’ in character, produced two further High Victorian Gothic<a id="r234"></a><a href='#f234' class='c025'><sup>[234]</sup></a>
works of the highest quality (Plate <a href='#pl092a'>92<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Unfortunately by the time the taste of the
authorities in the larger English cities caught up in the late sixties with the advanced
position of the High Church architectural leaders, those leaders had left that position far
behind. As a result, many of the biggest and most conspicuous public edifices are very
retardataire. Gothic designs won only low premiums in the Government Offices competition
in 1857, although both Street’s and Deane &amp; Woodward’s—on which Ruskin
advised—were of considerable distinction. When Alfred Waterhouse (1830-1905) two
years later won the competition for the Manchester Assize Courts he elaborated the
design of this large public structure along the rather unimaginative lines of Deane &amp;
Woodward’s earlier Oxford Museum, then just reaching completion.</p>

<p class='c010'>At best Waterhouse had a rather heavy hand and an uncertain sort of eclectic taste
somewhat like G. G. Scott’s. He lacked the cranky boldness of a Butterfield, the sophistication
of a Street, and the sense of craftsmanship of such men as Webb and Godwin
who were his own contemporaries. But he did have real capacity as a planner of large
and complex buildings, something at which most of the leading church architects had
little or no experience. Thus his Manchester Town Hall, begun ten years later than the
Assize Courts in 1869, while lacking all the refinement of Godwin’s smaller and earlier
ones, is a large-scale exercise in High Victorian Gothic of some interest. But inevitably
the High Victorian Gothic was a mode less well suited to this kind of monumental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>exploitation than the contemporary Second Empire mode as naturalized in England and
America. For all the skill of Waterhouse in the organization of plan and general composition
and in the bold detailing of materials inside and out, the Manchester
Town Hall is a late and inferior work—late, that is, in the phase of style which it represents,
though not so late in the highly successful career of its architect. It may properly
be compared, and to its own manifest advantage, moreover, with Schmidt’s Rathaus in
Vienna.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other most conspicuous High Victorian Gothic public monument, the Law
Courts in London, is the work of Street, an older and far more distinguished architect;
but it came very late indeed in Street’s career, so late that he died before it was finished
in 1882. Designed originally for a competition held in 1866, many years dragged by
during which the site was twice changed—once southward to the river’s edge and then
back to the north of the Strand—before it was even begun in 1874. Other work of the
late sixties and early seventies by Street indicates how completely his own taste had
turned away from this sort of French thirteenth-century Gothic even before the Law
Courts were started.</p>

<p class='c010'>At St Margaret’s in Liverpool, for example, which he designed in 1867, Street reverted
to English fourteenth-century models; thus, like Bodley at All Saints’, Cambridge, he
seemed to be returning to the particular stylistic ideal with which the ecclesiologists had
started out twenty-five years before. In the Guards’ Chapel at the Wellington Barracks
in London, however, which was all but completely destroyed in the blitz, he in 1877
remodelled the interior of an engineer-built Grecian edifice with incredible sumptuousness
in a sort of Byzantinoid Italian Romanesque, using a stone-and-brick banded barrel
vault and a glittering investiture of gold and glass mosaic that quite outshone the comparable
work of Continental architects in the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>. Then, in remodelling the
interior of St Luke’s, West Norwood, near London, built by Francis Bedford (1784-1858)
in 1823-5, equally Grecian, he used in 1878-9 round-arched Italian detail. Despite
the bold banding in brick and stone, this is certainly not Gothic or Byzantine, but rather
recalls the Tuscan Proto-Renaissance, or even the <i>quattrocento</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certain buildings by Deane &amp; Woodward and by Scott at Oxford and Cambridge
have already been mentioned; much more exists by Scott, Waterhouse, and various
others, very little of it of any distinction, yet sometimes fitting not too uncomfortably
into the general scene. The most striking example of Victorian Gothic architecture at
Oxford, fortunately on an isolated site opposite the Parks, where it had no neighbours
earlier than the Museum, is Butterfield’s Keble College, a complete entity in itself,
largely built in 1868-70. With its walls so violently striated with bricks of various colours,
Keble would have been a most disturbing increment to any existing college; on the
other hand, Butterfield’s quietly stone-banded chapel at Balliol of 1857 is that college’s
happiest feature, the rest being largely the work of Waterhouse.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since Keble was founded by Butterfield’s pious High Church friends for clerical
students, the chapel, which was added to the group in 1873-6, understandably dominates
the whole. Tall and richly decorated, this has many of Butterfield’s virtues, but it quite
lacks the directness and the poignance of his best work of the fifties and early sixties.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The hall and library are less monumental than the chapel, fitting more easily into the
ranges of sets that surround the two quadrangles. The over-all composition is fairly
regular, and there is less coarse or fussy detailing than Scott and Waterhouse used for
their ‘Collegiate Gothic’. Moreover, the scale of Keble is modestly domestic and,
despite its considerable size, the features are simple and crisp; but in the relatively clean
air of Oxford Butterfield’s polychromy has received less of the desirable mellowing
than it gets in London. The banded walls certainly lack the harmony that the softer
colours of the materials used in his country church interiors generally produced.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the time Keble was completed—indeed in advanced circles well before it was
begun—such polychromatic brashness was out of date. Yet at Rugby School, where
Butterfield’s buildings of 1868-72 awkwardly adjoin various earlier nineteenth-century
Gothic structures, the polychromy is even louder; moreover, it is still less mellowed by
time. Although Butterfield lived on through the rest of the century and continued to
build many churches and some schools, this first and boldest of High Victorian Gothic
architects was more and more left behind after the mid sixties by the evolving taste of
his own High Church milieu.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are other High Victorian Gothic collegiate groups which are, or would have
been if carried to completion, far finer than Keble. Being at less renowned institutions
than Oxford, they are less well known. University College on the sea-front at
Aberystwyth in Wales is by J. P. Seddon (1827-1906), from 1852 to 1862 a partner
of John Prichard. This structure was begun in 1864 to serve as a hotel, incorporating as
its most inappropriate nucleus a small Castellated villa built by Nash for Uvedale Price
in the 1780s. The failure of the hotel project, the slow and faltering start of the college,
and the necessary repair and rebuilding after two fires have left a complex pile of most
disparate character, even though it is almost all by Seddon. But certain aspects of the
building, the bowed section on the sea-front—originally the hotel bar, later the college
chapel!—and the entrance and stair tower on the rear are among the grandest and most
boldly plastic fragments produced in this period (Plate <a href='#pl091a'>91<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Neither Oxford nor Cambridge
has anything of comparable quality.</p>

<p class='c010'>For Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., Burges prepared in 1873 a splendid plan
worthy of its fine new site on a high ridge south of the city (Plate <a href='#pl088'>88</a>). Unfortunately
only one side of one quadrangle was finished according to his designs; but that is perhaps
the most satisfactory of all his works, and the best example anywhere of Victorian Gothic
collegiate architecture. The brownstone from nearby Portland, Conn., favourite
material all over the eastern states during what Lewis Mumford has called the ‘Brown
Decades’, is especially well suited to Burges’s heavy and well-articulated detail. The
rough quarry-facing of the random ashlar contrasts tonally with the more smoothly cut
trim in a fashion that is polytonal if not polychromatic. The roughness of the stone walls
also enhances the massive proportions of the long dormitory range and of the paired
towers with their boldly pyramidal roofs. Yet for the classrooms this masonry is articulated
into banks of large mullioned windows. Despite the general regularity and even
symmetry of the composition, there is plenty of functionally logical variety in the
handling of the different sections. Burges was happy in the Scottish-born Hartford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>architect who supervised the work, G. W. Keller (1842-1935); and Keller revealed his
continued debt to Burges in the construction of a Memorial Arch in the park in Hartford
which is one of the very few examples of such a Classical monument completely
translated into Gothic terms, and not without real interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burges undoubtedly enjoyed more what he did for the Marquess of Bute, beginning
in 1865, in restoring Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch in Wales. ‘Restoring’ should be
put in quotation marks, for by the time Burges got through with them both were
almost as much fake castles as any built in the first half of the century. They lie somewhere
between Fonthill Abbey and Peckforton in intention and are considerably more
sumptuous internally than either. Although Cardiff Castle, which had been subjected to
drastic Georgian remodelling, was gradually re-castellated with considerable consistency,
the work there never reached completion. It is chiefly the incredibly rich interiors
that are of interest, even if the interest is of a rather theatrical order.</p>

<p class='c010'>Castell Coch near Llandaff, restored in 1875, interiors of equal fantasy, almost
comparable to those of Neuschwanstein; that is, they are more like settings for Wagnerian
opera than anything the Middle Ages actually created. But the quality of the
imagination and of the execution is of a very much higher order than Ludwig II commanded.
Externally Castell Coch is a sober and plausible restoration-reconstruction
of a smallish castle, chiefly of archaeological interest, but most romantically sited and
solidly built. Beside its integrity the more famous restorations by Viollet-le-Duc at
Pierrefonds and Carcassonne appear rather harsh, and obviously modern.</p>

<p class='c010'>The McConochie house, built in Cardiff for Lord Bute’s estate agent, is one of the
best medium-sized stone dwellings of the High Victorian Gothic, superior in almost
every way to Burges’s own house at 9 Melbury Road in London. That was built later,
in 1875-80, by which time the operatic medievalism of the interiors was quite out of
date (see Chapter <a href='#ch12'>12</a>). Here in the Cardiff house the tight asymmetrical composition,
the excellent detailing of the handsome stonework, and a generally domestic rather
than Castellated air prepared the way for Burges’s fine collegiate work in America.</p>

<p class='c010'>English architects in the sixties were capable of exploiting a wide range of different
aspects of the High Victorian Gothic in almost precisely the same years. Only the size
and departmentalized organization of G. G. Scott’s office, the largest of the period and
more like the ‘plan-factories’ of the twentieth century (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>), can explain
how he could be nominally responsible for such a quiet, well-scaled, and advanced
church as St Andrew’s, Derby, designed in 1866—some say by Micklethwaite, who was
working for him at the time—and also for such a strident, complex, and over-elaborated
edifice as the Midland Hotel fronting St Pancras Station. The design for this was prepared
in 1865 for a competition held, curiously enough, two years after the shed had
been begun by the engineers W. H. Barlow (1812-1902) and R. M. Ordish (1824-86).
Such a drastic divorce of engineering and architecture could hardly be expected to produce
a co-ordinated edifice, yet both aspects of St Pancras have considerable independent
interest. The shed, ingeniously tied below the level of the tracks and rising, for purely
coincidental technical reasons, to a flattened point of slightly ‘Gothic’ outline, has the
widest span of any in the British Isles and, until the nineties, in the world. It is, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>a nineteenth-century spatial achievement of quantitative, if not so much of qualitative,
significance. The masonry block at the front is one of the largest High Victorian
Gothic structures in the world. It long had ardent admirers, and it has come to have
them again, for it epitomizes almost as notably as the Albert Memorial the aspirations of
Scott and his generation. The contrast to its neighbour, Lewis Cubitt’s Kings Cross
Station, begun some fifteen years earlier, or even to Paddington, where the engineer
Brunel and the architect Wyatt collaborated so happily, is striking. The taste of English
railway authorities, as of most patrons of architecture, had been revolutionized by the
general triumph of the High Victorian Gothic in the late fifties and early sixties. Yet on
its completion in the mid seventies St Pancras was even more out of fashion in advanced
circles than were Street’s Law Courts, the construction of which only began at that time,
so rapidly did taste continue to change in the late sixties and early seventies.</p>

<p class='c010'>By 1870 church architecture, for example, was in general much chastened. Externally
Teulon’s St Stephen’s, The Green, on Rosslyn Hill in Hampstead of 1869-76 is not polychromatic
but all of purple-brown brick with some creamy stone trim. It builds up,
moreover, somewhat like Shaw’s Bingley church begun a few years earlier, to a tall
rectangular crossing tower with rather quiet, more or less ‘Early French’, membering.
Inside Teulon achieved in the brickwork a kind of golden harmony of tone resembling
that of White’s interior in St Saviour’s, Aberdeen Park, completely eschewing the bold
and almost savage patterns of contrastingly coloured bricks he had favoured since the
early fifties. In the tremendously tall interior of Edmund Scott’s already mentioned St
Bartholomew’s, Brighton—aisleless, chancel-less, and provided with broad, flat
internal buttresses—the traces of brick polychromy are hardly noticeable on the walls of
a space so grandly proportioned (Plate <a href='#pl093b'>93<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The later ciborium here is not by Scott.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burges in the two Yorkshire churches which he began in 1871 at Skelton and at
Studley Royal, both near Ripon, the latter with a very fine rectory near by, still aimed
at a rather satiating luxury of both coloured and sculptural decoration in the interiors.
But Pearson at St Augustine’s, Kilburn Park Road, in London, initiated at this time a
new line of vast plain churches (Plate <a href='#pl093a'>93<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). That line would culminate in the archaeological
correctness of his Truro Cathedral in Cornwall, started in 1880 and finally
completed by his son (F. L., 1864-1947) in the present century. His last work, the
cathedral of Brisbane, Australia, designed shortly before his death in 1897, was only
begun by his son in 1901.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Pearson’s Kilburn church was built in 1870-80, it should perhaps more properly be
considered Late Victorian than High. But Pearson retained here and to the end of his
life, particularly in his tall towers and spires, a truly High Victorian love of grand and
bold effects. However archaeological he became, and with his passion for rib-vaulting
he could from this time on be rather more archaeological in a Franco-English way than
Viollet-le-Duc in France or Cuijpers in Holland, his spaces are usually nobly proportioned
and his masses crisply composed no matter how ‘correctly’ they are membered.
At Truro, where the cathedral rises suddenly out of narrow streets, its granite still
almost unweathered, Pearson’s handling of the relationship of the three tall towers
carries vigorous plastic conviction; Burges had attempted the same effect at Cork with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>rather less success when the High Victorian was still at its highest. Brisbane Cathedral is
plainer and tougher than Truro despite its very late date.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be inappropriate in this chapter to carry the story of Victorian Gothic much
further. Scott and Street died in 1878 and 1881 respectively, though Butterfield and
Bodley outlived Pearson. Butterfield seems to have frozen for life in the mode of his
early maturity, and as a result produced ever feebler work after the mid sixties; Pearson
was able to maintain a leading position with a younger generation grown chaster and
more archaeological in its standards without forsaking his pursuit of those more abstractly
architectonic values which give distinction to his earlier work. It was above all
Bodley, however, with his Late Decorated verging on Perpendicular, who set the pace
in Anglican church-architecture from this time forward. His personal style, still tentative
at All Saints, Cambridge, in the mid sixties, was mature by the time he built St
Augustine’s at Pendlebury in Lancashire in 1870-4. Crisp and almost mechanical in its
detailing, this tall rectangular mass, buttressed by an internal arcade, is impressive both
inside and out (Plate <a href='#pl092b'>92<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), yet it wholly abjures most of the qualities that had for two
decades given special vitality to English Neo-Gothic.</p>

<p class='c010'>With various modulations what might, rather ambiguously, be called ‘Bodleian
Gothic’ remained the favourite of Anglicans in and out of England well into the twentieth
century. The continuing admiration for the work of Sir Ninian Comper (1864-1960)
in certain milieus suggests that it has not even yet been finally superseded; but much of
Comper’s large-scale work dates from before Bodley’s death in 1907. For example, his
principal London church, St Cyprian’s in Glentworth Street, was built in 1903. This
crisp and clean example of revived Late Gothic, with its elegant gilt font-cover and
screen, may wind up this account more appropriately than the vast unfinished cathedral
at Liverpool begun by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (1880-1960), a grandson of the first G. G.
Scott, in 1903. But neither is Victorian Gothic; both are rather manifestations of one
aspect of twentieth-century ‘traditionalism’ (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> High Victorian Gothic produced in the United States no such roster of distinguished—or
at least prominent and highly characteristic—monuments as in Britain. The period
of its florescence was much briefer, and few assured and sophisticated talents came to the
fore. If, in the case of Richardson, one such did appear, his maturity came only in the
mid seventies, when the High Victorian Gothic was all but over. Why the period was so
much shorter in the United States, in effect only the decade 1865-75, is not altogether
clear. One reason, undoubtedly, is that the speed of transmission of new architectural
ideas from England to America had increased so much by the seventies that the influence
of the later English mode which succeeded the High Victorian Gothic around
1870 reached America very promptly indeed (see Chapters <a href='#ch13'>13</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). Another quite
different reason is that a wave of nationalism in America, parallel to those current in
North European countries at the time, encouraged from the mid seventies developments
that were more autochthonous. Leadership in commercial and in domestic architecture
crossed the Atlantic almost precisely at the moment when, in 1876, the centenary<a id="r235"></a><a href='#f235' class='c025'><sup>[235]</sup></a> of
American political independence was being celebrated.</p>
<p class='c010'>The phenomenal success in the United States of Ruskin’s treatises, <i>The Seven Lamps
of Architecture</i> of 1849 and <i>The Stones of Venice</i><a id="r236"></a><a href='#f236' class='c025'><sup>[236]</sup></a> of 1851-3, should be emphasized; from
1855 Street’s <i>Brick and Marble Architecture</i> was also available. Yet, despite the warm reception
of such relevant writings, few reflections of the High Victorian Gothic can be discerned
in American production before 1860. The first is probably the Nott Memorial
Library<a id="r237"></a><a href='#f237' class='c025'><sup>[237]</sup></a> at Union College, Schenectady, N.Y., designed by Edward T. Potter (1831-1904)
in 1856 and built in 1858-76. Here the banded arches are pointed and the plan is
circular, perhaps in emulation of the Pisa Baptistery to which Ruskin had called attention,
but more probably in deference to Ramée’s general plan for the college (see Chapter <a href='#ch01'>1</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The years immediately following the Panic of 1857 and, quite understandably, the
Civil War years 1861-5 were relatively unproductive of new buildings, as has already
been noted. An edifice far more overtly Ruskinian than Potter’s Library was the
National Academy in New York, built by Peter B. Wight (1838-1925) in 1863-5,
although apparently first designed as early as 1861. Its Venetian Gothic mode, with
pointed arches boldly banded and walls diapered in coloured stones, was still the subject
of considerable contemporary controversy as it would hardly have been in England by
this date.</p>

<p class='c010'>Potter and Wight were both young men. Established Gothic Revivalists in America
did not swing over as rapidly as in England from the Early Victorian to the High.
Upjohn, Potter’s master, was no Butterfield; Renwick when designing St Patrick’s
Cathedral in New York in 1859 followed contemporary Continental rather than
English models, as has been noted, presumably because his clients were Catholics.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>At best the sort of High Church Anglican patronage which sponsored Butterfield’s
and Street’s innovations in England was relatively much less important in the United
States—or Canada and Australia, for that matter. Enthusiasm for the High Victorian
Gothic, although widespread in the later sixties and early seventies, was rarely exclusive
as is evidenced by the disparate interests and activities of the members of the prominent
and successful firm of Ware &amp; Van Brunt. It has already been noted that when William
Robert Ware founded in 1865 the first American architectural school at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Boston, he based its instruction on that of the Paris
École des Beaux-Arts.<a id="r238"></a><a href='#f238' class='c025'><sup>[238]</sup></a> His partner Henry Van Brunt (1832-1903) was one of the first
to follow Richardson’s lead away from the High Victorian Gothic in the seventies. So
little were either of them dyed-in-the-wool Gothicists in these decades.<a id="r239"></a><a href='#f239' class='c025'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>However, Ware &amp; Van Brunt designed and built in Cambridge, Mass., one of the
largest and most conspicuous of mature High Victorian Gothic edifices in America,
Memorial Hall<a id="r240"></a><a href='#f240' class='c025'><sup>[240]</sup></a> at Harvard College, first projected in the late sixties and erected in
1870-8. This somewhat cathedral-like edifice has walls of red brick liberally lashed with
black and a massive central tower now denuded by fire of its high roof (Plate <a href='#pl095a'>95<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
The manner is more than a little Butterfieldian, but the quality is not even up to G. G.
Scott.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Memorial Hall was designed, a competition held in 1865 for the First Church
(Unitarian) in Boston in the new Back Bay residential district had brought out a
variety of rather feeble attempts by Boston architects to follow the High Victorian
Gothic line. The winning design of Ware &amp; Van Brunt, executed in 1865-7, while not
of the wilder Low Church order of Teulon’s or Keeling’s London work of these years,
is hardly comparable to Street’s or Butterfield’s, much less to the contemporary production
of younger architects such as Brooks, Bodley, or Shaw. Its best feature is the
material, the richly mottled and textured local Puddingstone from nearby Roxbury.</p>

<p class='c010'>The High Victorian Gothic of the sixties and early seventies in the United States was
no more restricted to the ecclesiastical field than in England. Despite its churchy look,
Memorial Hall served a variety of secular purposes from refectory to concert hall; only
the wide transeptal lobby was strictly memorial in purpose. But there was rarely even
such relative devotion to the Gothic in this period in the United States as the major
works of Ware &amp; Van Brunt display. For example, the untutored Elbridge Boyden
(1810-98), best known for introducing the cast-iron commercial front into New England
in 1854, could build two buildings for the Polytechnic Institute of Worcester, Mass.,
in the same year 1866 of which one, the Washburn Machine Shop, is mansarded with
crude, vaguely Second Empire, detailing; while the other, Boynton Hall, is in a very
provincial sort of High Victorian Gothic. Hunt, product of a Parisian education, designed
the Yale Divinity School in New Haven in 1869 in a frenzied, rather Teulonian,
Gothic; while in his precisely contemporary Lenox Library in New York, built in 1869-77,
he followed closely and with some dignity French, if not specifically Second Empire,
models.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not really surprising, therefore, that Richardson, returning from Paris and the
École des Beaux-Arts at the end of the Civil War and entering a competition for a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Unitarian church to be built at Springfield, Mass., offered a High Victorian Gothic
project that seems to derive rather directly from the work of Keeling and other Low
Church English practitioners. What <i>is</i> surprising, however, considering the lack of
special interest to later eyes in his Unity Church as executed in 1866-8, is the fact that
he won the competition! The warm colour and texture of the rock-faced brownstone
from nearby Longmeadow laid up in random ashlar, a certain masculine scale in the
details, and an attempt at least at a boldly asymmetrical composition evidently struck
his contemporaries as very promising, however. (The church was demolished in 1961.)</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not in the Unity Church, but in Richardson’s second church, Grace Episcopal,
in Medford, Mass., happily still extant, of 1867-8, that one recognizes strong personal
expression. The more massively pyramidal character of the asymmetrical composition
and, above all, the great boulders of which the walls are built, with heavy trim of
rough quarry-faced granite, announce an original approach (Plate <a href='#pl091b'>91<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Yet this approach
was evidently still nurtured on the English High Victorian Gothic models that
Richardson knew through the wood engravings in imported periodicals. It is even
specific enough here so that one can describe this Medford church as Burgessy rather
than Butterfieldian or Street-like; it is certainly no longer Keelingesque like the church
in Springfield. Incidentally, when Richardson visited England in 1882 it was the work
of Burges, who had just died, that he went out of his way to see—by that time, however,
he found it rather disappointing.</p>

<p class='c010'>If Richardson’s first churches were Gothic, his Western Railway Office at Springfield,
built in 1867 for a client associated with the Unity Church commission, was generically
Second Empire. Yet this was still more directly derived from current English work that
was closely related to that mode, notably the Francis Brothers’ National Discount
Building of 1857 in the City of London, than from anything Parisian. His brick and
stone Dorsheimer<a id="r241"></a><a href='#f241' class='c025'><sup>[241]</sup></a> house of 1868 in Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, N.Y., is also Second
Empire rather than Victorian Gothic, but very restrainedly so, and hence rather more
French in effect. Other work by Richardson dating from the late sixties, such as the
B. H. Crowninshield house in Marlborough Street in Boston of 1868-9, was more experimental
in design, often recalling wild English work of the early years of the decade.
Although built of wood and of very modest size, Richardson’s most interesting house
of this period was the one that he built for himself in 1868 at Arrochar on Staten Island
near New York.<a id="r242"></a><a href='#f242' class='c025'><sup>[242]</sup></a> This combines the use of a high mansarded pavilion with a sort of
imitation half-timbering related to the contemporary American ‘Stick Style’ (see
Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In Farnam Hall at Yale College in New Haven (Plate <a href='#pl096a'>96<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), begun in 1869, the German-trained
Russell Sturgis (1836-1909),<a id="r243"></a><a href='#f243' class='c025'><sup>[243]</sup></a> who had been for a time Wight’s partner,
somehow arrived at an almost Webb-like—or at least Brooks-like—simplicity and
sophistication of late High Victorian Gothic design, in marked contrast to the stridency
of Hunt’s precisely contemporary Divinity School there. This, however, is almost
unique. The most characteristic work of the day was produced by such home-trained
architects as Ware &amp; Van Brunt, Wight, Edward T. Potter, and his younger brother
William A. Potter (1842-1909).<a id="r244"></a><a href='#f244' class='c025'><sup>[244]</sup></a> Wight’s National Academy in New York has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>mentioned. His Mercantile Library in Brooklyn, N.Y., completed in 1869, of red brick
with ranges of pointed-arched windows regularly but asymmetrically disposed, is
similar—and not inferior—to much of G. G. Scott’s secular work. Edward T. Potter’s
Union College Library has also been mentioned. His Harvard Church in Brookline,
Mass., of 1873-5 is more conventional for its period. Largely renewed internally after
being gutted by a fire in 1931, this shows how effectively such American materials as
the popular brownstone from Portland, Conn., and the light-coloured Berea sandstone
from Ohio, enlivened by accents of livid green serpentine from Pennsylvania, could
produce a polychromy richer and more enduring than the endemic Butterfieldian or
Teulonian red brick, with banding of bricks dipped in black tar, that had been in general
use for a decade. Along this line Richardson himself followed for a while (see Chapter
13). At the same time William A. Potter, who became very briefly Supervising Architect
in Washington in succession to Mullet in 1875, produced a few post offices, such as
the one in Pittsfield, Mass., that are characteristic but not very distinguished examples of
secular High Victorian Gothic executed in stone. (Both Potters, however, gave up
the High Victorian Gothic to accept Richardson’s leadership within the next few years.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The Boston &amp; Albany Railroad station in Worcester built by Ware &amp; Van Brunt
in 1875-7, with its tall and striking tower and its vast segmental-pointed arches at the
ends of the shed, provides one of the happiest illustrations of what the rather illiterate
approach of even the most highly trained Eastern architects of this period could
produce. By working in an almost primitive way, along lines suggested by the half-understood
work of the bolder English innovators, something was often achieved of
which few Continental architects were capable in this period. In less sophisticated hands,
whether of provincial architects or of builders, the results were naturally still cruder,
though sometimes equally vital and fresh. In church design,<a id="r245"></a><a href='#f245' class='c025'><sup>[245]</sup></a> where ecclesiological control
of planning was not accepted outside the Episcopal denomination, galleried
auditorium schemes with rows of exposed iron columns were often executed with a
violence of polychromy and a gawkiness of notched detailing that exceeded Teulon or
Keeling at their most extreme. One of the most prominent extant examples is the
squarish New Old South Church at Copley Square in the Back Bay district of Boston,
built in 1874-5 by Charles A. Cummings (1833-1905) and his partner Sears in 1875-7.
Its impressive tower resembling an Italian campanile has now been much reduced in
height and chastened in silhouette.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even more extreme than most churches, but of the highest quality, is the intensely
personal work of Frank Furness (1839-1912)<a id="r246"></a><a href='#f246' class='c025'><sup>[246]</sup></a> in Philadelphia. His building for the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Broad Street was erected in 1872-6 in preparation
for the Centennial Exhibition. The exterior has a largeness of scale and a vigour in
the detailing that would be notable anywhere, and the galleries are top-lit with exceptional
efficiency. Still more original and impressive were his banks, even though they
lay quite off the main line of development of commercial architecture in this period
(see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). The most extraordinary of these, and Furness’s masterpiece, was the
Provident Institution in Walnut Street, built as late as 1879 (Plate <a href='#pl095b'>95<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This was most
unfortunately demolished in the Philadelphia urban renewal campaign several years ago,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>but the gigantic and forceful scale of the granite membering alone should have justified
its respectful preservation. The interior,<a id="r247"></a><a href='#f247' class='c025'><sup>[247]</sup></a> entirely lined with patterned tiles, was of
rather later character than the façade and eventually much cluttered with later intrusions,
but it was equally fine in its own way originally. Later work by Furness is of less
interest, and his big Broad Street Station of 1892-4 has also been demolished. No small
part of Furness’s historical significance lies in the fact that the young Louis Sullivan
picked this office—then known as Furness &amp; Hewitt—to work in for a short period after
he left Ware’s school in Boston. As Sullivan’s <i>Autobiography of an Idea</i> testifies, the vitality
and originality of Furness meant more to him than what he was taught at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, or later at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the realm of house-design the more-or-less Gothic-based ‘Stick Style’ represented
a largely autochthonous American development not without considerable significance
and interest (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). In public architecture there was little serious achievement
even at the hands of English-trained architects such as Calvert Vaux (1824-95) and his
partner F. C. Withers (1828-1901)<a id="r248"></a><a href='#f248' class='c025'><sup>[248]</sup></a> or second-generation Gothicists like Upjohn’s son
(Richard M., 1828-1903). The younger Upjohn’s Connecticut State Capitol<a id="r249"></a><a href='#f249' class='c025'><sup>[249]</sup></a> in Hartford
begun in 1873, the only major American example of a High Victorian Gothic
public monument of any great pretension or luxury of materials, is singularly vulgar
and stylistically ambiguous, with its completely symmetrical massing and its tall central
dome, compared to Burges’s contemporary project for Trinity College there.<a id="r250"></a><a href='#f250' class='c025'><sup>[250]</sup></a> Doubtless
G. G. Scott would not have disdained it, even so!</p>

<p class='c010'>Still more comparable to Scott’s own thwarted ambitions for a High Victorian Gothic
governmental architecture, which led him as late as the seventies to enter various Continental
competitions, is an earlier group of buildings in the New World outside the
United States, the Parliament House (Plate <a href='#pl097a'>97<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) and associated structures at Ottawa,
Canada, designed by Fuller &amp; Jones and Stent &amp; Laver in 1859 and built in 1861-7.
F. W. Stent had come out from England some considerable time before this, having last
exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1846. Thomas Fuller (1822-98), also
English, had settled in Toronto in 1856. Of their respective partners, Augustus Laver
(1839-98) and Herbert Chilion Jones (1836-1923), less is known. In the course of the work
Fuller and Laver joined forces, moving on shortly to the United States, as has been noted.</p>

<p class='c010'>The main block at Ottawa, which was by the first-named firm, has been rebuilt after
a fire in the present century in a considerably chastened vein, except for the big chapterhouse-like
library at the rear, which is original. But the variety of form, the gusto of the
detail, and the urbanistic scale of this project made of the Dominion Capitol a major
monumental group unrivalled for extent and complexity of organization in England.<a id="r251"></a><a href='#f251' class='c025'><sup>[251]</sup></a>
The buildings flanking the vast lawn extending in front of the Parliament House are by
Stent &amp; Laver. These are somewhat less exuberant in scale and more provincial in the
character of their detailing than the Parliament House was originally.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most of the Neo-Gothic in Canada up to this time is more properly to be considered
Early rather than High Victorian (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>). An exception to this, perhaps, is
University College in Toronto, designed in 1856 by F. W. Cumberland (1821-81), who
had come out from England in 1847. Yet its rich and rather bombastic Norman design
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>is closer to English work of the earlier decades of the century than to the round-arched
Ruskinian Gothic of the fifties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Australia, the other major British Dominion, had nothing comparable to Canada to
offer in this period. Wardell’s English, Scottish, and Australian Bank in Melbourne is a
passable example of secular High Victorian Gothic but no more than that. St John
Evangelist’s, which he built at Toorak south of Melbourne in 1860-73, is handsomer
but very simple—still almost Puginian, indeed—and all of monochrome ashlar. The
enormous Catholic cathedral of Melbourne, St Patrick’s, which Wardell began in 1860,
is more Continental in character, with two west towers like Renwick’s St Patrick’s in
New York and also a tall crossing tower completed only in 1939. The Catholic cathedral
of Adelaide, St Francis Xavier’s, begun in 1870 and still without its intended western
spires, reputedly goes back to a design prepared by Pugin before his death in 1852.
But even the later design of his son E. W. Pugin, on which the executed work was
actually based, must have been much modified over the years by W. H. Bagot (b. 1880),
H. H. Jory (b. 1880), and Lewis Laybourne-Smith (b. 1888), who successively supervised
the job. It is certainly no happier an example of High Victorian Gothic than Wardell’s
Catholic cathedral in Melbourne.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Anglican cathedral in Melbourne, St Paul’s, having been begun in 1850 from designs
by Butterfield, ought to be finer. But Butterfield had made the drawings as early
as 1847, before even he was a High Victorian, and the laggard execution of the church
by Joseph Reed evidently entailed much modification of the original designs. Moreover,
the spires by John Barr date only from 1934. For the very late Anglican cathedral
at Brisbane, St John’s, perhaps the finest of the lot, which was begun in 1901 by
F. L. Pearson from earlier designs by his father J. L. Pearson as has already been mentioned,
Butterfield had also prepared designs in 1884.</p>

<p class='c010'>The architecture of the Dominions remained Colonial in spirit, as these notes on a few
Australian churches indicate, well into the present century. First the able Frank Wills,
moreover, the English-born architect of Montreal Cathedral, and then Fuller &amp; Laver
were drawn away from Canada to the United States, where opportunities were greater.
Despite the great interest of the Government Buildings at Ottawa, it was in the United
States rather than the British Dominions that the High Victorian Gothic proved a
stimulus to such highly original achievement as Furness’s in the seventies.</p>

<p class='c010'>The High Victorian Gothic episode in American architecture balanced almost precisely
the Second Empire episode. Both were disowned, even by many of their most
successful protagonists, by the mid seventies. It was the Gothic, however, that prepared
the way for the more original developments of the last quarter of the century; as has
already been stated, those who had practised chiefly in the Second Empire mode continued
to take their lead from Paris. Yet there are paradoxes in the situation which must
not be ignored. Richardson, the most creative new force in the seventies and eighties,
continually urged young aspirants to an architectural career to study at the École des
Beaux-Arts as he had done. Charles F. McKim (1847-1909), Richardson’s first really able
assistant, was Paris-trained; partly because of that training, it was he who became in
the mid eighties the leader of the reaction against the Richardsonian. Sullivan, the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>truly great modern architect not alone of America but of the whole western world, was
also in part Paris-trained, even though he was always highly critical of the doctrine of
the École and much stimulated by Furness. Finally, it was even more the later writings
of the French Viollet-le-Duc than those of the English Ruskin that encouraged bold and
imaginative thinking about architecture in America in the seventies and eighties when
his <i>Entretiens</i> became available in translation and were first widely read.<a id="r252"></a><a href='#f252' class='c025'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Were this a history of architectural thought rather than of architecture—that is of what
was actually <i>built</i> in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries—Viollet-le-Duc would play
a much larger part. But his production,<a id="r253"></a><a href='#f253' class='c025'><sup>[253]</sup></a> while not negligible, is curiously ambiguous.
His many ‘restorations’ are no contribution to nineteenth-century architecture; rather
they represent a serious diminution of authenticity in the great monuments of the past
subjected to his ministrations. These include most notably Notre-Dame in Paris, the
refurbishing of which he continued alone after the death of Lassus in 1857, and the
Château de Pierrefonds, Oise, the rebuilding of which began the next year and continued
down to his death in 1879; but the whole list is very long indeed, including Carcassonne,
Vézelay, and Saint-Denis, to mention only some of the best known things.</p>

<p class='c010'>Viollet-le-Duc’s new parish church for the suburb of St-Denis, Saint-Denys-de-l’Estrée
in the Boulevard Jules Guesde, built in 1864-7, has considerable interest, however. Unlike
most English High Victorian Gothic churches, it is vaulted throughout; but the
vaulting does not have that look of a student exercise which characterizes Lassus’s at
Saint-Jean-de-Belleville in Paris of the previous decade. The broad square bays of the
nave are well lighted by groups of lancets in the clerestory, and there is a sturdy sort of
articulation of the elements not unlike that in the early work of Burges (Plate <a href='#pl098'>98</a>). Externally
the rather complex plan, with a large rectangular Lady Chapel projecting behind
the altar, produces a gawky and confused composition; but the detailing is simple
and virile as in the interior. A massive western tower rises over the entrance porch, culminating
in a tall slated roof rather than a stone spire. But the plate tracery of the large
west window over the porch and the lancets of the stage above are stony enough and
have a quite Street-like scale and vigour of form. It is perhaps unfortunate that Viollet-le-Duc
built so few new churches; certainly most other French Neo-Gothic work is
very inferior to this, as such a large and prominent church as Saint-Epvre at Nancy,
begun in 1863 by M.-P. Morey (1805-78), a pupil of Leclerc, well illustrates.</p>

<p class='c010'>In secular work Viollet-le-Duc was too often content to follow the current Second
Empire mode with a good deal of the eclecticism, but little of the plastic boldness, of the
English and the Americans. Such more or less Gothic blocks of flats as those that he built
in the late fifties and sixties in the Rue de Condorcet and at 15 Rue de Douai in Paris are
somewhat more comparable to the secular High Victorian Gothic in
England (Plate <a href='#pl101a'>101<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). These are certainly praiseworthy for
the urbanistic politeness with which they fit
between more conventional Second Empire neighbours despite their distinctly ‘Victorian’
detail,<a id="r254"></a><a href='#f254' class='c025'><sup>[254]</sup></a> but there is little originality of conception. On paper Viollet-le-Duc
later showed great boldness, however, in certain projects proposing the use of metal
structural elements that he published with the second volume of the <i>Entretiens</i> (see
Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>In the late fifties and sixties the vigour of the ‘Early French’ detailing of certain English
architects and a related logic of structural expression then called ‘real’ was often
derived in part from a study of Viollet-le-Duc’s <i>Dictionnaire</i>. But Shaw’s book of
<i>Continental Sketches</i> of 1858 and Nesfield’s similar book of 1862 make evident how intense
and how idiosyncratic was their own first-hand study of medieval work across the
channel. Certainly the ‘Early French’ detail of the English leaders is generally of higher
quality than even Viollet-le-Duc’s best at Saint-Denys-de-l’Estrée.</p>

<p class='c010'>If there was very little Gothic work done in the third quarter of the century in France
comparable in quality or in interest to that of the Anglo-Saxon countries, yet there was
a general movement there away from the somewhat mincing attitudes of the forties and
early fifties. Just as the Medieval Revival in America, considered in a broad sense, came
to its climax in the mature work of Richardson (see Chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>)—which is much more
Romanesque than Gothic in so far as it leans at all on the past—in France the Romanesquoid
work of Vaudremer represents the highest achievement of the period in a non-Renaissance
mode (Plate <a href='#pl072a'>72<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The same may even be said up to a point of most of the
other countries of Europe. Yet the Germanic <i>Rundbogenstil</i> of the third quarter of the
century was, for all the size, prominence, and elaboration of such public monuments as
Waesemann’s Berlin City Hall or Hansen’s Vienna Waffenmuseum and the real excellence
of Herholdt’s Danish work, already a sinking rather than a rising mode.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Germany and Austria more Neo-Gothic edifices, both secular and ecclesiastical,
were built after 1850 than before; several of them have already been mentioned. These
are, however, rather examples of contemporary eclecticism than of a concerted movement.
In addition to his school and his Rathaus, however, Schmidt built in Vienna some
eight Gothic churches ranging in date from the Lazaristenkirche of 1860-2 to the
Severinkirche of 1877-8. Most of them are brick-vaulted hall-churches—that is, of the
characteristic medieval German plan and section, with aisles of the same height as the
nave. However, the largest and most interesting, the Fünfhaus Parish Church of 1868-75,
is centrally planned. This is an aisled octagon rising to a ribbed dome with hexagonal
chapels grouped around the irregularly polygonal apse (Plate <a href='#pl099b'>99<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The spatial complexity
of the interior is of real interest, and the walls are painted to suggest polychromatic
brickwork of almost English brashness. Two front towers flanking the gabled entrance
bay are set close against the dome to provide a very Baroque sort of composition—this
is really, therefore, a sort of Sant’ Agnese in Agone or Karlskirche carried out with a
G. G. Scott vocabulary of Neo-Gothic elements.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Hungary the eighties saw a very belated manifestation of secular Neo-Gothic.
The Parliament House, begun in 1883 by Imre Steindl (1839-1902) and completed in
1902, was surely inspired by Barry’s in London begun nearly a half-century earlier, but
in character it is (not surprisingly) more like Schmidt’s Vienna Rathaus. Thus did outlying
countries in the later decades of the century continue to take up modes long obsolescent
in the major architectural centres.<a id="r255"></a><a href='#f255' class='c025'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Gothic of C. F. Arnold (1823-90) at Dresden, as seen in his secular Kreuzschule
of 1864-5 or the two-towered Sophienkirche of the same years, is inferior to Schmidt’s,
both in command of the idiom and in architectonic organization, as indeed is most such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>German work of these decades. The Johanniskirche in Dresden of 1874-8 by G. L.
Möckel (1838-1915), however, has a rather fine tower set in the transeptal position
so much favoured in Victorian England. This is bold in scale and carefully detailed
in a literate twelfth-century—not to say ‘Early French’—way much as Burges or
Pearson might have designed it in England. More characteristic of German work of
these decades is the Munich Rathaus, built in 1867-74 by G. J. von Hauberrisser (1841-1922)
and extended by him in 1899-1909. Excessively spiky, this seems almost to have
borrowed back from G. G. Scott the more Germanic features of his Broad Sanctuary
terrace in London of fifteen years earlier. But the Neo-Gothic of the seventies and
eighties in Germany is in general no more aggressive and gawky than the popular
Meistersinger mode that revived so turgidly the forms of the Northern Renaissance (see
Chapter <a href='#ch10'>10</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Holland, which made almost no significant architectural contribution in the first half
of the nineteenth century, now produced in P. J. H. Cuijpers (1827-1921) a sort of
Dutch Viollet-le-Duc. In addition to undertaking important restorations, he built many
vast new Gothic churches of brick which he exposed once more in reaction against the
earlier nineteenth-century practice of stucco-coating. Cuijpers was learned and ambitious,
and in such work he could be rather more original than Viollet-le-Duc in
France, if less so perhaps than Schmidt in Austria. His Vondelkerk, a church of 1870
near the Vondel Park in Amsterdam, is not centrally planned like Schmidt’s Fünfhaus
church in Vienna, but he obtained a somewhat similar spatial effect by making the crossing
octagonal. The brickwork of the piers and the vaults is very richly treated but in a
fashion as much polytonal as polychromatic. The banding is in bricks of different sizes
and textures rather than of different colours, and the result has something of the subtlety
of the interior of White’s Aberdeen Park church in London.</p>

<p class='c010'>A larger and later Amsterdam church by Cuijpers, the Maria Magdalenakerk in the
Zaanstraat of 1887, is considerably more impressive, both inside and out. Occupying
one of those narrow triangular sites so often assigned to important urban churches in this
period, the exterior builds up grandly to the rather severe crossing tower at the rear. Inside,
Cuijpers made the most of the difficulties of the site also. The east end is conventionally
Gothic in plan, and the choir here is brick-vaulted, as is the Vondelkerk
throughout. But the taller nave, covered with a wooden roof of ogival section, is much
more effective spatially because of the way it is widened by triangular elements at the
front where the aisles are cut off owing to the narrowing of the site (Plate <a href='#pl101b'>101<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The
later painted decorations in this church are harmonious in tone with the brickwork, and
the whole has a breadth of attack comparable to some of the best English churches of the
seventies, such as Pearson’s in Kilburn or Edmund Scott’s St Bartholomew’s, Brighton,
without resembling any of them very much.</p>

<p class='c010'>Curiously enough for so dedicated a church-builder, Cuijpers’s secular work is more
conspicuous, and hence better known, than are his churches. The two largest and most
prominent nineteenth-century buildings of Amsterdam are both by him. In these, the
Rijksmuseum built in 1877-85 (Plate <a href='#pl101c'>101<span class='fss'>C</span></a>) and the Central Station of 1881-9, he moved
away from the emulation of thirteenth- or fourteenth-century ecclesiastical Gothic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>towards a more elastic sixteenth-century sort of design, rather similar to the English
mode of these decades known as ‘Pont Street Dutch’ (see Chapter <a href='#ch12'>12</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The similarity to the Northern Renaissance mode of this period in Germany is nearly
as great, as also to such somewhat later Scandinavian buildings as Clason’s Northern
Museum in Stockholm and Nyrop’s Town Hall in Copenhagen (Plate <a href='#pl173a'>173<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But Cuijpers’s
touch is lighter than that of the Germans, and his precedent rather more Late
Gothic than Mannerist, while his two chief works precede those that they most resemble
in Sweden and Denmark by a decade or more. In both cases the frank incorporation of
iron-and-glass elements is notable, a vast shed at the station and two almost equally vast
covered courts in the museum. Above all, being the Gothic Revivalist he was, Cuijpers
saw to it that the craftsmanship was excellent throughout; while his handling of scale,
though ambiguous as in much work of these decades everywhere, is surprisingly successful.
Both are very large buildings, placed in isolation where they can be seen from a distance
and with carefully studied silhouettes varied by towers and other skyline features;
yet the membering is delicate and almost domestic, quite as in the rather comparable
English work of George (Plate <a href='#pl104b'>104<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) or Collcutt (see Chapter <a href='#ch12'>12</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In Italy projects of restoration led, as elsewhere, to the designing of certain fairly ambitious
new façades in Gothic to complete medieval churches. The most conspicuous is
that of the cathedral of Florence. After many abortive earlier moves, this was finally
begun by Emilio de Fabris (1808-83) in 1866, when Florence became briefly the capital
of Italy, and completed only in 1887. The earlier and less successful façade of Santa
Croce in Florence had been carried out in 1857-63 by Niccoló Matas (1798-1872). It is
characteristic of the international architectural scene in these decades that neither of these
carefully archaeological compositions in polychrome Italian Gothic comes alive in the
way that Italianate High Victorian Gothic often did in the hands of English architects,
or even American ones, in the fifties and sixties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Churches were built for Anglicans in most of the principal cities of Europe in the mid
nineteenth century, usually by English architects and always in Victorian Gothic.
Sometimes, as in the case of the Crimean Memorial Church by Street<a id="r256"></a><a href='#f256' class='c025'><sup>[256]</sup></a> at Istanbul and
Shaw’s English Church at Lyons, these were by the most distinguished English designers
of the day, but more often they were by hacks who lived abroad and specialized
in such work. Among the ‘English churches’ of this period that provided good samples
of the High Victorian Gothic for foreigners—many were still to all intents and purposes
Early Victorian—are two by Street<a id="r257"></a><a href='#f257' class='c025'><sup>[257]</sup></a> in Rome, one for the English community, the
other not ‘English’ at all in fact but built for American Episcopalians. The former, All
Saints’, in the Via del Babuino, with a much later tower not by Street, provides internally
a moderately successful example of his later work, although it is unimpressive and
largely invisible externally. It was begun in 1880, a year before Street’s death, and opened
in 1885.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far finer is St Paul’s, the American church, prominently located among the contemporary
banks and blocks of flats of the Via Nazionale and built in 1873-6. Boldly banded
in brick and stone and with a tall square campanile at the front corner, this is indeed a
richer and more striking example of an Italian Gothic basilica than the Middle Ages ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>produced in Rome (Plate <a href='#pl100'>100</a>). The interior, with a rich apse mosaic by Burne-Jones
on a glittering gold ground, has an originality and a coherence that is quite lacking in
such Italian churches as were redecorated in the later nineteenth century. Late though
this is in Street’s <i>œuvre</i>, it remains one of his best works.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the English High Victorian Gothic was to some extent an article of export—and,
of course, this account has hardly touched on the vast outlying areas of the British
Empire, notably including India, to which it was exported in the greatest quantity—it
was nevertheless largely without real influence outside the United States and the British
Dominions. In the world picture, it was the British architectural critics of this period,
Ruskin and Morris, who would have a vital influence, but that influence came for the
most part rather later, around 1890 (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). Cuijpers, however, was a reader
of Ruskin from the fifties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still to be discussed is the early work of one great architect, also reputedly a reader of
Ruskin, whose career began in the seventies with a sharp revulsion from the Second
Empire mode towards the Neo-Gothic. The Spanish (or more precisely Catalan)
architect Antoni Gaudí i Cornet (1852-1926) was one of the most intensely personal
talents that either the nineteenth or the twentieth century has produced. His style
hardly matured before the nineties, and what are generally considered his typical works
must be discussed later in connexion with the Art Nouveau (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). But
what he had accomplished already in the seventies and eighties can be better appreciated
here in relation to the contemporary work of those decades in other countries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gaudí’s earliest work was at the Parc de la Ciutadella in Barcelona, laid out in 1872,
where he assisted the master of works Eduardo Fontseré, while still a student, in various
projects for its embellishment. The elaborate Cascade there, incorporating an Aquarium,
on which he worked in 1877-82 derives in the main from Espérandieu’s at the Palais
Longchamps in Marseilles. But some of the detail, both plastic and incised, has a flavour
more comparable to that of the wildest and most eclectic English and American Second
Empire work of the previous decade than to anything French.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first commission for which Gaudí was wholly responsible is the house of Don
Manuel Vicens at 24-26 Carrer de les Carolines in Barcelona. This was erected in 1878-80,
immediately upon his graduation from the local Escuela Superior de Arquitectura,
and in it no trace of Second Empire influence, French or international, remains. A large
suburban villa built of rubble masonry liberally banded with polychrome tiles, the
Casa Vicens passes beyond the extravagances of a Teulon or a Lamb in the sixties into
a world of fantasy that only one or two High Victorian designers such as the Scottish
Frederick T. Pilkington (1832-98) ever entered. Yet Gaudí’s general inspiration came
definitely from the medieval past. In Spain that past included the semi-Islamic Mudéjar,
however, and much of the detailing which appears most original to non-Spanish eyes
is, in fact, dependent on local precedents of one sort or another. For example, the
floral tiles are merely what the Iberian world knows as <i>azulejos</i> and has continued to
use down to the present time, especially in Portugal and Brazil (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In all the flamboyance of the decoration of the Casa Vicens, the most personal note is
in the ironwork. This is naturalistic in theme and bold in scale; it also includes curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>linear elements that wave and bend in a way which is more than a little premonitory of
the Art Nouveau of the nineties (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). The entrance grille is a masterpiece of
decorative art of this period, rivalled only by some of Morris’s contemporary stained glass.</p>

<p class='c010'>The very utilitarian industrial warehouse for La Obrera Mataronense of 1878-82 at
Mataró, with its great arched principals of laminated wood, should be mentioned to
balance the Casa Vicens. Here Gaudí’s prowess as an imaginative constructor—almost
a straight engineer—was very evident, as also the fact that the unfamiliar forms he continually
used—the shape of the arches here was parabolic not semicircular or pointed—were
not a matter of personal crankiness but selected for statical reasons: Gothic in
theory, that is, like some of Soufflot’s vaulting, though not very Gothic in appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1884, however, Gaudí was made director of works for a large new Gothic church
in Barcelona, and from this time forward a considerable part of his activity, extending
down through his restoration of the cathedral of Palma on the island of Mallorca in
1900-14, was that of a Gothic Revivalist, if an increasingly unconventional one. Towards
such a career his own intense religiosity inclined him quite as much as was the case with
Pugin and reputedly also with Cuijpers—Viollet-le-Duc, by exception, was strongly
anti-clerical. Unlike Pugin’s or Cuijpers’s, however, Gaudí’s career as an ecclesiastical
architect was rather unproductive. Yet from the first he designed and executed church
furnishings and, while still a student in 1875-7, he assisted the architect Francesc de
Paula del Villar i Carmona (1845-1922) on a project for adding a porch to the monastery
church of Montsarrat.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1881 Villar was made architect of the proposed Expiatory Temple of the Holy
Family (Sagrada Familia),<a id="r258"></a><a href='#f258' class='c025'><sup>[258]</sup></a> for which a large square site had been obtained between the
Carrers de Mallorca, de Marina, de Provença, and de Sardenya in an outlying part of
Barcelona, and the construction of the crypt of a great cruciform Gothic church was
started in 1882. Two years later Gaudí took over charge of the work, as has been said,
completing the crypt by 1891 almost entirely according to Villar’s original and quite
conventionally thirteenth-fourteenth-century Gothic design. There followed the construction
of the outer walls only of the chevet; these were finished by 1893. The further
history of the church will be considered later; for Gaudí’s style underwent extraordinary
changes in the nineties as he designed and built one transept façade of the church and its
towers—which is about all that exists above ground even today (see Chapter <a href='#ch17'>17</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Contemporaneously with Gaudí’s construction of the crypt and the chevet walls of
the Sagrada Familia came four secular works, two of them also quite Neo-Gothic in
character and two others of very great originality. The Bishop’s Palace at Astorga of
1887-93 and the Fernández-Arbós house, known as the Casa de los Botines, in the Plaza
de San Marcelo at León of 1892-4 might well be mistaken for provincial High Victorian
Gothic done in England or America twenty or thirty years earlier. But the city mansion
of Don Eusebio Güell at 3-5 Carrer Nou de la Rambla (now Conde del Asalto) in
Barcelona, built in 1885-9, is an edifice of the greatest distinction, rivalled for quality in
its period only by the very finest late work of Richardson in America (see Chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>).
The Teresian College at 41 Carrer de Ganduxer in Barcelona is also quite remarkable in
its simpler way.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Far suaver than his earlier Casa Vicens, the Palau Güell is quite as strikingly novel all
the same. At the base yawn a pair of parabolic arches, their tops filled above a plain
reticulated grille with sinuous seaweed-like ornament of the most extravagant virtuosity
(Plate <a href='#pl096b'>96<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The ‘Dragon Gate’ of the Finca Güell of 1887 in
the Avenida Pedralbes is
still stranger, with a nightmare quality which those of the house in town happily
lack. On either side of the entrance arches and in the projecting first storey the façade
of the Palau Güell is no more than a rather plain rectangular grid of stone mullions and
transoms. In scale this grid is more like Parris’s Boston granite fronts of the twenties than
like English window-walls, but it is detailed in a cranky medievalizing way that is more
comparable to Webb’s handling of stonework (Figure <a href='#i203'>17</a>). The rear façade towards the
court includes in the middle a broad bay-window with curved corners protected by sunscreens
as original but less fantastic than the grilles at the entrance. The most extraordinary
features of the exterior, however, are the chimney-pots rising in profusion
above the flat roof like an exhibition of abstract sculpture and entirely covered with a
mosaic of irregular fragments of glass, rubble, or coloured tiles. In them the extravagance
of his earlier houses was continued, and such terminal features remained characteristic
of all his later secular work.</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 17. Antoni Gaudí: project for Palau Güell, Barcelona, 1885, elevation</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The interiors of the Palau Güell are extremely sumptuous. There is much use of
marble arcades of parabolic arches carried on round columns, both arches and columns
being detailed with the greatest mathematical elegance and simplicity, yet with considerable
variety. Some of the ceilings are of marble slabs carried by visible iron beams,
but in the principal apartments there are incredibly elaborate confections of woodwork
in the Moorish tradition.</p>

<p class='c010'>The College of Santa Teresa de Jesús, built in 1889-94 immediately after the Palau
Güell, is naturally much more modest than that great merchant’s palace, which continues
the line of those that late medieval and Renaissance magnates often built. Rubble walls
banded and stripped with brickwork are pierced alternately with ranges of narrow windows
and with small square ventilators closed with quatrefoil grilles. The widely spaced
windows are capped with steep parabolic ‘arches’ formed by cantilevering inward successive
brick courses. The third storey is all of brickwork panelled with blind ‘arches’
between the windows and carried up into large, flat, triangular finials along the skyline.
Less ingratiating than the Palau Güell with its luxurious use of fine materials inside and
out, this college building is equally regular in composition and no more Gothic in
appearance to a non-Spanish eye; in fact, however, it leans even more heavily on
Mozarab and Mudéjar precedent than does the Casa Vicens. A certain amount of relatively
plain wrought-iron grillework recalls that at the entrances of the earlier houses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only perhaps in England and America did the line of descent from the Gothic Revival
lead so far away from the standard medievalism of the mid century in the seventies and
eighties. But these early works of Gaudí represent only a part—to most critics the less
important half—of his production. For strangeness they can be matched in work of
equal consequence within this period only by Sullivan’s earliest commercial façades in
Chicago (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). Teulon and Harris had reformed by the seventies; Lamb and
Pilkington were forgotten. In character Gaudí’s work of the seventies and eighties could
hardly be more different from the mature style of the English Shaw. Yet Shaw, at his
occasional best, could compete with Gaudí in the quality of his achievement; while his
influence, both at home and in the United States, was of very considerable historical
importance, as Gaudí’s was not, even in Spain
(see Chapters <a href='#ch12'>12</a>, <a href='#ch13'>13</a>, and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>For all that Gaudí was actually represented at the Paris Exhibition of 1878—by a
glovemaker’s vitrine!—and later by pavilions designed for the Compañía Transatlántica
in the Naval Exhibition of 1887 at Cadiz and in the Barcelona International
Exhibition of the following year, his work was hardly known at all except to his compatriots
before the nineties. In the mid twentieth century, however, his reputation is still
rising, as the flood of new publications of the last decade makes evident. The reasons
for this will be suggested later, since they apply chiefly to the work that he did after 1900
(see Chapters <a href='#ch16'>16</a> and <a href='#ch20'>20</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the European picture as a whole a less notable shift of direction occurred around
1870 than in England and America. There was naturally continuity in the Vienna of
Francis Joseph, since the Imperial government called the tune in Austrian architecture
and the King-Emperor’s reign went on without a break—indeed, it lasted for another
generation and more. What is surprising is that the end of the Second Empire and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>beginning of the Third Republic brought so little change in France. There was, of
course, a short hiatus in production like that which followed the fall of the first Napoleon.
As around 1820, however, so around 1875 the story picks up again almost as if
there had been no break at all. Gradually interest in exposed metal construction, in decline
since the fifties, revived; by the time of the Paris Exhibition of 1889 French feats of
metal construction, not so much the Galerie des Machines as the Eiffel Tower, became
the talk of the world (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the fugue-like composition of nineteenth-century architectural history different
themes have differing durations. The English theme of High Victorian Gothic, picked
up in any case only by the Anglo-Saxon sections of the orchestra, came effectively to an
end with the early seventies; the Second Empire theme, whether it be considered in a
specialized sense or in a broader one, was picked up at least selectively by the whole
western world and not least boldly by the Anglo-American section; moreover, it continued
in most countries, with some modulation, for at least a decade longer than the
High Victorian Gothic. Yet both in England and America, the important new themes of
the seventies and eighties were rooted not in the Second Empire but in the Victorian
Gothic, even though they represent something much more original than mere modulations
of that earlier theme.</p>

<p class='c010'>The third quarter of the nineteenth century is notable for the stylistic diversity of its
production. In principle there may, perhaps, be no more difference between Visconti’s
and Lefuel’s New Louvre and a Butterfield church than between Nash’s Blaise Hamlet
and his terraces around Regent’s Park, to cite merely work by one early nineteenth-century
architect. Yet thanks to the fugal character of the general historical development,
which meant that new modes were added to the architectural repertory—as they
had been at least since the twenties—more rapidly than old modes were dropped, the
over-all picture became extremely complicated after 1850. It belies the most valid and
idiosyncratic achievements of this period, however, to stress too much its apparently
limitless eclecticism.<a id="r259"></a><a href='#f259' class='c025'><sup>[259]</sup></a> The account given in the last four chapters undoubtedly exaggerates
the importance of certain modes, if that importance be measured statistically in
terms of quantity of production. Qualitative considerations have led to a drastic selectivity,
emphasizing relatively limited but vital aspects of architectural production at the
expense of others that were far more ubiquitous but generally very dull. With different
criteria of selection, using different standards of architectural quality—attainment of
archaeological plausibility, say; or success or failure in the incorporation of new technical
developments; or realization of programmatic aims—several very different pictures
could be, and indeed frequently have been,<a id="r260"></a><a href='#f260' class='c025'><sup>[260]</sup></a> given of the architecture of the
western world in these decades.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the expense of emphasizing architectural developments peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon
world in this same, possibly unbalanced, fashion the next chapter is organized
around the career, after 1870, of Norman Shaw, whose early work in the High Victorian
Gothic has already received some attention. The chapter following that centres on
the achievement of the American architect Richardson, whose somewhat parallel
beginnings have also been described in this chapter.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>In</span> England and America there followed immediately upon the ‘High Styles’ of
the fifties and sixties phases of stylistic development that cannot readily be matched in
the other countries of the western world. This is true both of the quality of the achievement
and also of its significance for what came after. Beginning just before 1870 in
England and but little later in the United States, these two phases developed in far from
identical ways. In both cases their conventional names, ‘Queen Anne’ and ‘Romanesque
Revival’, are misnomers. It was a long time before the Queen Anne of the seventies
actually became a revival of early eighteenth-century architecture in the same sense as
the Greek, Gothic, or Renaissance Revivals. The supposed Romanesque Revival in
America of this period was not very archaeological either. It is therefore less inaccurate
to label these modes by the names of their principal protagonists: ‘Shavian’ for Richard
Norman Shaw (even though that proper adjective refers more familiarly to George
Bernard Shaw) and ‘Richardsonian’ for Henry Hobson Richardson. Shaw, however,
shares responsibility for the effectiveness of the mutation away from the High Victorian
with other men, notably his early partner Nesfield, Webb, Godwin, and J. J. Stevenson.<a id="r261"></a><a href='#f261' class='c025'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
Of all this group, Shaw was unquestionably the most successful, the most typical,
and the most influential, though not the most original.</p>
<p class='c010'>Except for Pugin, no architect since Robert Adam had so much effect on English—and
for that matter also on American—production. Moreover, his influence lasted for
some thirty-five years, rather longer than did Adam’s. Yet it is not possible to define the
Shavian mode clearly as it is the Adamesque or the Puginian. An architectural Picasso,
Shaw had many divergent manners which he developed successively, but of which
none—except the High Victorian Gothic—was ever entirely dropped. Each of these
manners, down to the very end of his long practice, found in turn a following. His latest
and most conspicuous work, the Piccadilly Hotel, built in London in 1905-8 between
Piccadilly and the Regent Street Quadrant (Plate <a href='#pl107'>107</a>), is more characteristic of the Edwardian
Age of the opening twentieth century than his early church at Bingley is of the
High Victorian. Outside church architecture the intervening Late Victorian can hardly
be defined better than in terms of his various manners, and even in church architecture
he had a real contribution to make, if a lesser reputation than Pearson or Bodley.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet Shaw cannot be rated with Soane or Schinkel as a nineteenth-century architect of
absolutely the first rank; nor yet with his American contemporary Richardson, even
though Richardson’s career came to an end a score of years before his. Shaw’s work reflects
all too clearly, despite his own vast and sanguine assurance, the general uncertainties
of the years after 1870. Webb, though less successful and famous, eventually had
more influence, not so much on English architecture in general as on the more creative
and original men of the next generation. The later history of European architecture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>would be much the same—if not that of American architecture—had Shaw never
existed; but the modern architecture that first came into being after 1900 in various
countries of Europe owed something directly, and even more indirectly, to Webb. In
this way Richardson also has more significance than Shaw, despite his lack of influence
abroad, for Sullivan and Wright in America both learned much from him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Norman Shaw was born in Edinburgh in 1831. Brought early to London, he was
taken on in his early teens by Burn, the Edinburgh architect then settled in London, who
had so great a success designing Jacobethan and Scottish Baronial mansions for the high
aristocracy in the forties and fifties. Shaw also studied at the Royal Academy, winning
in 1853 their Silver Medal, and in the next year their Gold Medal, with the award of a
Travelling Studentship that took him to Germany, Italy, and France. The project which
won him the first medal was a surprising production for its period, and quite without
relation to his own High Victorian Gothic work of the next decade that has been described
earlier (see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>). A vast design for a college with central domed block
and side pavilions loaded with giant orders, this project is more Vanbrugh-like than
Second Empire. In some sense Shaw’s career was to come full circle stylistically; but
even in the Gaiety Theatre in the Strand in London of 1902-3 and the still later Piccadilly
Hotel he would hardly be as whole-heartedly Neo-Baroque again.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1858 Shaw published, as has been mentioned before, what is perhaps the most
attractive of High Victorian Gothic source-books, <i>Architectural Sketches from the Continent</i>,
based on his European studies; doubtless on the strength of this book he became
at this time, or shortly after, Street’s principal assistant—chief draughtsman, one might
call it—in succession to Webb.<a id="r262"></a><a href='#f262' class='c025'><sup>[262]</sup></a> There he remained for four years, leaving in 1862 to
form a partnership with Nesfield, whom he had first known in the early fifties in Burn’s
office. As has already been noted, Nesfield was the son of Barry’s collaborator in garden
design for all his major country house commissions. Younger than Shaw, Nesfield had
gone to Burn’s office in 1850 a year or two after leaving Eton, and in 1853 had moved
to the office of his uncle Anthony Salvin, another successful builder of aristocratic
country houses. Nesfield, in this year 1862, issued a book rather like Shaw’s of four years
earlier as has been mentioned in connexion with his work for Lord Craven at Combe
Abbey. Other aristocrats with whom he had connexions through his father soon began
to employ him on more modest jobs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Building lodges and other accessories to great country estates, and in 1864 one in
Regent’s Park where everyone might appreciate his highly personal touch, Nesfield revived
in effect the Picturesque Cottage mode of half a century earlier. But the materials
he used were more various,<a id="r263"></a><a href='#f263' class='c025'><sup>[263]</sup></a> including tile-hanging and pargetting, and his designs had
a general finesse that was much more craftsmanlike than those of the slapdash Nash and
his rivals in this genre (Plate <a href='#pl050a'>50<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). In Nesfield’s first major work, Cloverley Hall in
Shropshire, begun in 1865, several characteristic features appear for which his lodges
hardly prepared the way (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). There a tall great hall provided the principal
interior, and the areas of mullioned windows in the Tudor tradition were so extensive
as to constitute real ‘window-walls’ (Figure <a href='#i261'>24</a>). His very refined and ingenious ornamentation
at Cloverley, some of it of Japanese inspiration, has been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Even earlier, in 1862, when Japanese art was just beginning to be an inspiration to
advanced painters in Paris and in London and the Japanese Government first sent
examples of characteristic work to an international exhibition, Godwin, who was just
at that point throwing off the influence of Ruskin, had stripped bare the interiors of his
own house in Bristol and decorated them only with a few Japanese prints asymmetrically
hung. By 1866 Godwin was designing wallpapers of notably Japanese character for
Jeffry &amp; Co. and from 1868 ‘Anglo-Japanese’ furniture for the manufacturer William
Watt.<a id="r264"></a><a href='#f264' class='c025'><sup>[264]</sup></a> But <i>japonisme</i> is only a minor theme of this period,<a id="r265"></a><a href='#f265' class='c025'><sup>[265]</sup></a> and it hardly influenced
Shaw at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Half a century earlier the prestige of a ranking novelist, Sir Walter Scott, had helped
to launch one of the most popular Picturesque modes, the Scottish Baronial, when he
asked Blore to imitate the old Border castles in designing his house at Abbotsford. Now
in 1861 Thackeray, a novelist many of whose novels were set, not in the Middle Ages,
but in early eighteenth-century England and Virginia, designed for himself a house in
Palace Green in London opposite Kensington Palace, much of which is more or less
of that particular period. This house echoes the modest red-brick manor houses of the
time of Queen Anne on both sides of the Atlantic, but it could hardly be less plausible.
At the same time Wellington College by John Shaw (1803-70), which was begun in
1856, was reaching completion in a much richer, almost Second Empire, version of the
Wren style of 1700.</p>

<p class='c010'>The serious adumbration of a Queen Anne mode really began a few years later with
a small public commission of Nesfield’s. His lodge at Kew Gardens, designed in 1866
and built in 1867, though simple, is already almost an archaeological exercise in early
eighteenth-century<a id="r266"></a><a href='#f266' class='c025'><sup>[266]</sup></a> brickwork (Figure <a href='#i208'>18</a>). This Kew lodge he followed up a few
years later with a big but remote country house, Kinmel Park near Abergele in Wales,
built in 1871-4 though possibly designed a bit earlier. To this we will be returning
shortly. Shaw had nothing to do with Kinmel Park, since his partnership with Nesfield
came to an end in 1868; that was just after the completion of Cloverley Hall on which
he certainly collaborated even if his personal contribution there cannot now be readily
distinguished. Already in 1866, before Shaw parted from
Nesfield, however, his own career had opened with the
designing of the Bingley church (Plate <a href='#pl094a'>94<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) and of Glen
Andred, near Withyham in Sussex, a house of great
originality of character (Plate <a href='#pl102b'>102<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Glen Andred is little more related to the new Queen
Anne mode of the Kew lodge than it is to the Gothic
of the Bingley church. It does, however, seem to derive
somewhat from earlier Nesfield work, or possibly from
Devey. Where the High Victorian Gothic had rejected
English precedent in favour of Italian and French models,
this first Sussex house of Shaw’s is resolutely regional in
character. The tile-hung walls above a red-brick ground
storey, the white-painted wooden casements, almost as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>extensive as the ‘window-walls’ of Cloverley, the loose asymmetrical organization of the
massing are all related to a local Sussex and Surrey vernacular of no particular period
(Plate <a href='#pl102b'>102<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The entrance front is more formal, carefully balanced if not precisely symmetrical,
and here the pargetting in the central gable is of Jacobethan character. But the
great stair-window and the graceful massing of the tiled roofs, quite in the finest tradition
of the Picturesque but handled with a new ease and casualness, are more important
elements of Shaw’s first manner, which can be called ‘Shavian Manorial’. The hall
across the front between the two projecting wings is modest in size, with the principal
living rooms loosely grouped round it. Thus this may be considered an early example
of what I have rather clumsily called the ‘agglutinative plan’, but as it was never published
the extent of its actual influence must remain uncertain.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was little logic to Shaw’s regionalism. Already in 1868 he was applying his
Sussex vocabulary of materials and forms to the Cookridge Convalescent Hospital at
Horsforth near Leeds in stony Yorkshire. In general, however, he kept this manner for
work near London, using it even as late as 1894 for a house called The Hallams near
Bramley in Surrey. He also introduced tile-hanging on some of his houses in London
such as West House, at 118 Campden Hill Road, of 1877 and Walton House in Walton
Street of 1885 as well as—rather more appropriately—on the suburban Hampstead
house that he built in the same year for Kate Greenaway at 39 Frognal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shaw’s first client had been a painter, J. C. Horsley, R.A., for whom he made some
alterations in the early sixties and whose son later entered his office. Glen Andred was
for another painter, E. W. Cooke, later R.A., and West House was for George Boughton,
R.A. Kate Greenaway, better known today than these forgotten academicians, was
an illustrator of children’s books much patronized by Ruskin. F. W. Goodall, R.A.
(1870), Marcus Stone, R.A. (1876), Luke Fildes, R.A. (1877), Edwin Long, R.A. (1878,
and again in 1888), Frank Holl, R.A. (1881), are other successful painters and fellow
academicians—Shaw became an A.R.A. himself in 1872 and an R.A. in 1877—for whom
he built houses (with the dates of the commissions). All but Goodall’s house at Harrow
Weald were either in Melbury Road in Kensington in London or else in Fitzjohn’s
Avenue near his own Hampstead house of 1875 at 6 Ellerdale Road. Where the prosperous
artists, themselves presumably aping the aristocracy, led, magnates and City men
were now quick to follow. The Newcastle steelmaster Sir William Armstrong had
Shaw build Cragside near Rothbury in Northumberland for him as early as 1870.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leyswood, near Withyham in Sussex, begun in 1868 at the same time as the Cookridge
Hospital, was one of Shaw’s most influential works (Plate <a href='#pl123'>123</a>). More archaeologically
manorial than Glen Andred, it provided a mass of suggestions that English and
American architects borrowed again and again over the next twenty years and more.
Because of Shaw’s later leadership, it is natural for posterity to note what was new here;
contemporaries, used to the wild vagaries of the High Victorian Gothic, saw Leyswood
rather as a reaction against the ‘modernism’ of the fifties and earlier sixties. Tile-hung
upper storeys and barge-boarded gables, richly half-timbered—the half-timbering a
mere sham applied over solid brickwork!—long banks of casements that approach the
twentieth-century ‘ribbon-window’ and great mullioned bays providing ‘window-walls’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>as extensive as Nesfield’s at Cloverley clothed an interior that was not at all
medieval but a more developed example than Glen Andred of the ‘agglutinative plan’
(Figure <a href='#i210'>19</a>). The main reception rooms were grouped about a central hall, from one side
of which rose elaborate stairs arranged in several flights about an open well. Webb had
already essayed this sort of planning in a more orderly way at Arisaig begun in 1863
(Figure <a href='#i260'>23</a>); but it was Shaw’s version, not Webb’s, that was generally imitated (see
Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<div id='i210'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i210.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 19. Norman Shaw: Leyswood, Sussex, 1868, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Shortly after Leyswood, and following fairly closely its manner although with fewer
Late Gothic elements of detail, came the house later called Grim’s Dyke built at Harrow
Weald in 1870-2 for F. W. Goodall, afterwards the country house of the composer
W. S. Gilbert, and Preen Manor in Shropshire also designed in 1870. Then followed
Hopedene, near Holmbury in Surrey, and Boldre Grange, near Lymington in Hampshire,
in 1873; Wispers, Midhurst, in Sussex, in 1875; Chigwell Hall in Essex, and
Pierrepoint, near Farnham in Surrey, in 1876; Merrist Wood near Guildford in Surrey,
and Denham at Totteridge in Hertfordshire, in 1877; and so on down into the nineties.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>After their showing each year at the Royal Academy Exhibition Shaw’s brilliant pen-and-ink
perspectives of these houses were published photo-lithographically in the professional
press; moreover, from 1874 the plans were usually given as well, the first
published being that of Hopedene. Not surprisingly these were the most influential of
Shaw’s works abroad, providing in the late seventies and early eighties one of the most
important sources of the American ‘Shingle Style’ (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). Beside them,
moreover, Webb’s more prominent London works of the late sixties, the house for
George Howard, later Earl of Carlisle, built in 1868 near Thackeray’s in Palace Green,
Kensington, and the small office building at 19 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, also of 1868, appear
somewhat cranky and overstudied, still rather too Gothic in detail and lacking the
comfortable air of his country-house work. However, the modest London studio-house
at 14 Holland Park Road, Kensington, which was designed in 1864 and built in 1865
for Val Prinsep, like Morris and Spencer Stanhope one of the crew of artists who worked
on the decoration of the Oxford Union, must have been more like the Red House and
Benfleet Hall before it was recurrently enlarged by Webb in the following decades.
Another London studio-house for the water-colour painter G. B. Boyce at 35 Glebe
Place, Chelsea, which was begun in 1869, is in rather better condition today and quite
exemplary in its quiet way despite some changes by Webb and others.</p>

<p class='c010'>At this point came Nesfield’s Kinmel Park. Shaw and other advanced architects must
have been aware of the character of the designs for this house from 1870 or 71, even
though it was neither shown at the Royal Academy nor published then, and took some
four years to complete. Kinmel is much more complicated stylistically than Nesfield’s
Kew lodge of 1866-7, but it offers the next step in the development of the new Queen
Anne mode. At first sight it might appear to be related rather to Second Empire
work, for the main block on the entrance side is symmetrical, high-roofed, and dominated
by a bold central pavilion. Moreover, the detailing of the red-brick façades with
their profuse light-coloured stone trim is almost as French of Louis XIII’s time as it is
English of Queen Anne’s day. The garden front, which is carefully ordered but not
symmetrical, and the service wing to the south, much more loosely composed and with
a profusion of small-paned double-hung sash-windows and dormers, are more definitely
English and also more original.</p>

<p class='c010'>Webb had been using such windows and even approaching the Late Stuart vernacular
in his houses for a year or two before Kinmel was begun. This was most evident at
Trevor Hall (Figure <a href='#i262'>25</a>), built at Oakleigh Park near Barnet in Hertfordshire in 1868-70,
for that modest country house was quite symmetrical in design although almost
devoid of any sort of ‘period’ detail, whether Gothic or Late Stuart. To more acclaim,
Webb had also been responsible for designing with William Morris a little earlier, in
1866 and in 1867, the Armoury in St James’s Palace and the Refreshment Room in the
Victoria and Albert Museum. The former, particularly, is a very original masterpiece of
nineteenth-century decoration, hardly at all related to the contemporary High Victorian
Gothic, yet reflecting the eighteenth century only as regards the treatment of the wainscoting
and the door and window casings (which may be of eighteenth-century date).
The Refreshment Room is also very fine and now accessible to the public (Plate <a href='#pl097b'>97<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Just after 1870, while Kinmel was still in construction, the main line of development
moved from the country into London. The Education Act of 1870 required the building
of innumerable new schools, particularly by the London School Board. Among the
architects successful in the first competitions that were held for designs for these schools
were E. R. Robson (1835-1917) and J. J. Stevenson (1831-1908); they used a non-Gothic
vocabulary in London stock bricks trimmed with red bricks cut or moulded
along seventeenth-century vernacular lines.<a id="r267"></a><a href='#f267' class='c025'><sup>[267]</sup></a> This mode was not unrelated to the more
definitely Queen Anne models provided by the Kew lodge and by Kinmel, but the
new London schools were more irregular in composition and naturally much more
cheaply built. Robson, appointed architect to the London School Board in 1871, soon
made this mode the official one for schools in London County and this, of course, before
long influenced Board School design nationally.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1871 Stevenson, like Shaw a Scot out to make a London reputation, built a new
house for himself in what is now Bayswater Road. This he named the Red House, like
Morris’s at Bexley Heath of a decade earlier, in order to call attention to the fact that its
brickwork was not covered with stucco but exposed like that of the Thackeray and
Howard houses in Palace Green. In fact, however, it was built like the Board Schools of
brownish stock bricks with red-brick detail elaborately moulded, gauged, and cut in the
Late Stuart way. Although Stevenson’s house had little of the real elegance of Kinmel
or the natural ease of Shaw’s manors, its novelty and its fairly conspicuous location
would have attracted attention in any case. But Stevenson, a very accomplished publicist,
saw the advantage of proclaiming for this hybrid mode a name, ‘Queen Anne’,
which was evidently no less applicable to Nesfield’s Kew lodge and Kinmel or even to
his friend Robson’s schools. Thus was a revival formally launched.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two new buildings in London by Shaw, begun in 1872 and in 1873, were definitely
in the new mode. Only at this point, indeed, does the term Queen Anne begin to make
any sense as applied to Shaw’s work. Despite the valid claim to priority that Stevenson
made for his Red House in a paper read in 1874 at the Architects’ Conference ‘On the
recent reaction of taste in architecture’ in which he claimed the Queen Anne mode
was a ‘Re-Renaissance’ (<i>sic</i>), and his own relative success from this time on as a fashionable
London house-architect, the Queen Anne became Shaw’s from the moment that he
first turned his hand to it in 1872. Whether the original idea came to him from Devey or
from Nesfield—he had probably worked himself on the drawings for the Kew lodge—or
was merely an attempt to outbid a rival Scotsman on the London scene makes no real
difference.</p>

<p class='c010'>New Zealand Chambers, the office building which Shaw erected in 1872-3 in Leadenhall
Street in the City, was certainly totally unlike anything the Age of Anne ever saw
except for the cut-brick detailing of the pedimented entrance. Boldly projecting red
brick piers divided the tall façade into three bays, while between them rose oriel windows
broken by ornately sculptured spandrels imitated from the mid-seventeenth-century
ones on Sparrow’s House at Ipswich. The small panes and thick white sash-bars
of these windows made the scale surprisingly domestic in contrast to the usual boldness
of High Victorian commercial work, and the whole composition was effectively tied together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>by an ornately pargeted cove cornice that ran straight across the top (see Chapter
14). Above this the rather simple range of continuous dormers in the roof was very
much in the spirit of the ‘ribbon-window’ bands on his country houses.</p>

<p class='c010'>So dazzled were contemporaries by the lush exuberance of Shaw’s ornament on the
spandrels and the cove that they hardly noticed the way in which the bold articulation
of this façade by the brick piers, with the areas between nearly all window, frankly reflecting
the internal iron construction, provided most satisfactory lighting for the
offices; nor that Shaw, while keeping his scale intimate in all the detailing, was not
afraid to stress the verticality of his façade by avoiding emphasis on the storey lines.
Only the weaker features of the design—the arbitrary asymmetry of the entrance, the
profuse ornamentation, and the underscaling—were generally imitated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lowther Lodge, built in 1873-4, a large free-standing mansion in Kensington Gore,
still survives—it is now the home of the Royal Geographical Society—as New Zealand
Chambers does not. Here the vocabulary of cut and moulded brick is more consistently
Late Stuart, although the general composition, with many gables, two tall polygonal
bay-windows, quantities of dormers, and tall fluted chimney stacks, is as romantically
complex as that of Shaw’s manors in Sussex and Surrey. However, both the front and
the rear façades, when studied, will be found to approximate symmetry in their principal
portions as does the front of Glen Andred; and the main rooms inside, the hall at
the front and the drawing-room behind, are quite symmetrical and have recognizably
Early Georgian (rather than specifically Queen Anne) fireplaces and door and window
casings, although their grouping is still, so to say, agglutinative.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a Surrey house of the same date, 1873, like Trevor Hall unhappily demolished,
Webb moved rather farther in a similar direction. Joldwynds near Dorking was quite
as symmetrical as Trevor Hall but even less Gothic. The vocabulary of tile-hanging on
the upper storeys, with weather-boarding in the gables, was as authentically regional as
that of Shaw’s nearby houses, but the vaguely eighteenth-century vernacular of the detailing
was much simpler than Shaw’s repertory of moulded and cut brickwork at
Lowther Lodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nesfield, in designing what is now Barclays Bank in the Market Square of Saffron
Walden in Essex, remained more eclectic, staying closer to the manorial mode of
Cloverley Hall yet using again various Japanese motifs in the rich decoration. This was
built in 1874. Godwin, who had just moved to London with the actress Ellen Terry and
was now largely occupied with designing stage sets, developed further in the rooms of
their rented house in Taviton Street in 1873-4 the Anglo-Japanese mode of his interiors
of ten years earlier in Bristol. In 1874 he also arranged an exhibition of paintings in a
similar spirit for his friend the painter Whistler at the new Grosvenor Galleries.<a id="r268"></a><a href='#f268' class='c025'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In the mid seventies, however, it was Shaw, not Nesfield or Godwin, who occupied
the centre of the architectural stage. In the Convent of the Sisters of Bethany of 1874 in
St Clements Road at Boscombe near Bournemouth he disguised his use of concrete,
then a relatively new building material, with his familiar Sussex vernacular. He did the
same in a slightly later series of designs for cottages made of patented prefabricated concrete
slabs.<a id="r269"></a><a href='#f269' class='c025'><sup>[269]</sup></a> It is worth noting, moreover, that the internal iron skeleton above the bold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>cantilever on the front of his Old Swan House (Plate <a href='#pl103'>103</a>) of 1876 at 17 Chelsea Embankment
in London provides in effect an example of what would later be called ‘skyscraper
construction’, since it carries completely the weight of the brickwork of the upper walls;
this was a decade before the ‘invention’ of this sort of construction in Chicago (see
Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). Shaw’s interest in technical developments and his enthusiasm for new
materials and methods was evidently very great, always provided that he could bend
them to his particular sort of retroactive pictorial vision. When he built the Jury House
for the Paris Exhibition of 1878 of patent cement bricks, for example, he designed the
façade very elegantly in his Late Stuart manner just as if it were of cut and moulded clay
bricks. Godwin and Whistler, however, were showing at this same exhibition an
Anglo-Japanese room of highly original character in association with Watt the furniture
manufacturer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shaw’s excellent church of this period at Bournemouth, St Michael’s and All Angels,
Poole Hill, begun in 1873, is Late Victorian in the crispness and clarity of its design but
less archaeological than those of this date by Bodley. It seems to indicate that he could
have made a great reputation as a church builder had he not been absorbed with secular
work. But by the seventies secular work once again provided the field of major prestige
in England, as it had hardly done since 1840, and so Shaw concentrated on it. Having
revolutionized country-house design, he now turned, more definitely than at Lowther
Lodge—by its size and open siting more a country house set in the city—to urban and
suburban domestic work. In these his conquest was even more complete, at least in
England and, as regards the suburbs, in America.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Old Swan House and its neighbour Cheyne House at the outer end of the Chelsea
Embankment, respectively of 1876 and 1875, are both mansions rather than ordinary
terrace houses. They also represent a considerably further advance along the road towards
a formal eighteenth-century revival than Lowther Lodge. Old Swan House is
completely symmetrical, and the upper storeys are also quite regularly fenestrated in the
early eighteenth-century way (Plate <a href='#pl103'>103</a>). However, the total effect is still highly Picturesque
because of the way these upper storeys are cantilevered forward; from the
cantilever depend, moreover, elaborate oriels of much earlier character very similar to
those Shaw had introduced at New Zealand Chambers. Such oriels he long continued
to employ; they are not only a principal feature of his own house in Hampstead, built in
this same year, but also of the much later Holl and Long houses. Cheyne House occupies
an irregular curving plot with the entrance in Royal Hospital Road; but Shaw
used all his considerable ingenuity to give it symmetrical façades, even though the
plan actually has little of the orderliness of that of Lowther Lodge.</p>

<p class='c010'>If these two Chelsea houses seem to presage an early return to the serenity of Georgian
street architecture, Shaw’s J. P. Heseltine house of 1875 at 196 Queen’s Gate in South
Kensington unleashed a flood of the most individualistic house-design London had ever
seen. Stucco-fronted houses of builders’ Renaissance design were still being erected on
contiguous sites when this tall gabled façade rose, totally oblivious of old and new
neighbours. Cut brick, moulded brick, terracotta, all of the brightest red, surround
very large mullioned windows in a composition that is gratuitously asymmetrical at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the base but symmetrical in the upper storeys below the crowning gable. For fifteen
years such houses proliferated in the Chelsea, Kensington, and Earls Court districts of
western London. The best are by Shaw himself, such as those at 68, 62, and 72 Cadogan
Square—the first of 1879, the others of 1882—and those at 8-11 and 15 Chelsea Embankment
of 1878-9; but more are by other architects, and the vast majority by builders. In
the Chelsea Embankment range River House at No. 3 is by Bodley; Nos 4-6 are by
Godwin; and No. 7 is by R. Phéné Spiers (1838-1916), an architect whose Parisian training
did not restrain him from following Shaw.</p>

<p class='c010'>Collingham Gardens of 1881-7 by Sir Ernest George (1839-1922) and his then partner
Harold A. Peto (?-1890), a sort of square with variously designed houses, all gabled, opening
on to a lawn in the centre, provides a still more complete illustration of what may be
called Neo-Picturesque urbanism. Not at all Shavian, the detailing of many of these
houses is very similar to that of Cuijpers’s Rijksmuseum and none of it Queen Anne.
The contiguous mansions that George &amp; Peto built in 1882 near by in Harrington Gardens,
one for W. S. Gilbert at No. 19 (Plate <a href='#pl104b'>104<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), the other for Sir Ernest Cassel, the
banker, are the most elaborate single London examples of their domestic work. The
house of the composer of the Savoy Operas approaches very closely the German
Meistersinger mode of the period, but the touch is much lighter—intentionally whimsical
perhaps?—and both the organization of the whole and the execution of the profuse
detail is very superior to what one finds in most contemporary German work (see
Chapter 9).</p>

<p class='c010'>Stevenson’s best and most Shavian houses in London are two that he built in 1878 in
partnership with A. J. Adams in Lowther Gardens behind Lowther Lodge; however,
those he built at 40-42 Pont Street have a certain interest because the mode that he exploited
here is often called ‘Pont Street Dutch’, so ubiquitous is it in this part of Chelsea.
This name also emphasizes the characteristic tendency of the late seventies and eighties
towards varying the English late seventeenth-century vernacular mode by the introduction
of Dutch and Flemish elements of detail, usually executed in terracotta, as
George &amp; Peto did in most of the Earls Court houses mentioned above. Thus, by the
late seventies, the long-established London tradition of coherent terrace design came to
an end. That was, on the whole, a real urbanistic misfortune, however excellent some of
the best individual houses by the above-mentioned architects may be.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shaw’s venture into the suburbs initiated a new domestic tradition of positive value
and also a tradition of ‘planning’ that has continued with some modification down to
the present, both in England and abroad. At Bedford Park, Turnham Green, then well
beyond the western edges of built-up London, Shaw laid out in 1876 and largely designed
an early ‘Garden Suburb’ (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>), in fact, almost a ‘new town’, similar
in some ways to the New Towns of the present post-war period, but without any industries
of its own. Small houses, mostly semi-detached, i.e., in pairs, stand in their own
gardens, simply and casually built of good red brick with a certain amount of modest
Queen Anne detailing. The scheme is very complete, including a church by Shaw that is
most ingeniously styled to harmonize with the domesticity of the houses, a club, a tavern,
shops, and so forth.<a id="r270"></a><a href='#f270' class='c025'><sup>[270]</sup></a> Godwin’s assistant Maurice B. Adams (1849-1933) and E. J. May
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>(1853-1941) also worked here, as well as Godwin himself; indeed, some of the best
houses are not by Shaw but by Godwin.</p>

<p class='c010'>With characteristic versatility, while the construction of Bedford Park was proceeding
in this simplified version of his middle manner, Picturesque but distinctly anti-Gothic,
Shaw was also erecting at Adcote in Shropshire in 1877 a large Tudor manor
house in reddish stone. This is notable for its restrained, almost ‘abstract’, detailing
and for the tall mullioned window-wall of the hall bay, more than rivalling that of
Cloverley Hall. Flete, a still larger house in Devon begun the year after Adcote, is also
Tudor. Dawpool in Cheshire, demolished in 1926, was begun in 1882 in much the
same mode but was even more extensive and elaborate than Flete. J. F. Doyle (1840-1913)
of Liverpool collaborated on this.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bedford Park church of 1878, St Michael’s, is more or less Queen Anne, at least
not at all Gothic. But at Ilkley in Yorkshire Shaw’s St Margaret’s of the previous year is
a remarkably personal essay in the Perpendicular, low and broad and elegantly detailed.
In quality this is well above his earlier Bournemouth church and rather more original in
its proportions than the standard work of Bodley and his imitators at this time. Somewhat
similar, and still more original, is St Swithin’s in Gervis Road in Bournemouth,
also of 1877; while All Saints’, Leek, of 1886 carries almost to the point of parody the
Shavian stylization of English Late Gothic proportion towards the broad and low—visually,
that is; ritualistically they are quite as ‘High’ as Bodley’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next Shaw produced his finest and most creatively conceived church, Holy Trinity,
Latimer Road, comparable in quality to his early church at Bingley but wholly different
in character. This was built in 1887-9 for the Harrow Mission in a poor district of
western London. The interior of Holy Trinity is a single vessel, very broad and moderately
low, covered by a flat-pointed wooden ceiling which is tied by vigorous horizontal
members of iron cased in wood and heavily buttressed externally (Plate <a href='#pl106a'>106<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Behind
the chancel, which is no more than a square dais on which the altar is raised, rises an
ecclesiastical version of the Shavian window-wall, broad and low like the space it terminates
but arched and lightly traceried at the top. The result could hardly be more
different from Shaw’s domestic Queen Anne of these years. It is on such things as this
church, in which his basic architectural capacities are revealed unconfused by frivolous
elaboration of detail, that his claim to high talent, occasionally to genius, must be based.</p>

<p class='c010'>If Shaw did not cease to design churches while continually extending the range of his
secular practice, it is a still more notable testimony to the breadth of his approach that he
built in 1879, in Kensington Gore between the Albert Hall and Lowther Lodge—and
with a characteristic disregard for both—the first really handsome block of flats erected
in London; the first, that is, unless one prefers the Second Empire ones of the late
sixties in Grosvenor Gardens. The tall and extensive mass of this block, like that of
most of his houses of the period, is extremely picturesque in silhouette because of the
very tall and ornate gables that face the Park. But these are quite regularly spaced and the
walls below them, with the multitudinous segment-arched, white-sashed windows all
evenly phrased in threes, illustrate Shaw’s Queen Anne of the seventies at its most
disciplined (Plate <a href='#pl104a'>104<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).<a id="r271"></a><a href='#f271' class='c025'><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>As has been noted, Shaw was by now the preferred architect of most of his fellow
Royal Academicians. Webb had built houses for several of the Pre-Raphaelite painters
who were his friends and associates. Less successful and more advanced painters employed
Godwin. Small though it is and now much remodelled, the White House in
Tite Street round the corner from the Chelsea Embankment, which Godwin built for
his friend Whistler in 1878-9, has one of the most original façades of the decade. As its
name implies, although all of brick, it was not ‘red’ like Morris’s and Stevenson’s
famous houses, but ‘white’ because the walls were so painted,<a id="r272"></a><a href='#f272' class='c025'><sup>[272]</sup></a> recalling perhaps the
white-painted Colonial farmhouses of Whistler’s New England youth. The sparse detail
is related in its vaguely eighteenth-century character to the Shavian Queen Anne,
but it is much more delicate and linear, indeed almost Late Georgian in inspiration.
Most significantly, the composition of the façade as a whole, and even more evidently
the asymmetrical placing of the door and windows, owes a great deal to those abstract
principles of Japanese art which both Whistler and Godwin had been studying for
almost twenty years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whistler had to sell his house almost as soon as it was finished in order to pay the
costs of his unhappy libel suit against Ruskin, a legal battle in which the Late Victorian
and the High Victorian came to violent grips. But Godwin went on to build several
more studio houses in Tite Street at Nos 29, 33, and 44 in the next few years and also
the Tower House in 1885. Similar, but inferior, is No. 31 by R. W. Edis, which John
Singer Sargent later occupied. Also in Tite Street is the commonplace terrace house
at No. 16, of which the interiors were decorated by Godwin for Oscar Wilde,<a id="r273"></a><a href='#f273' class='c025'><sup>[273]</sup></a>
the greatest aesthete of them all. Wilde’s influential ideas in this field, carried to America
on a lecture tour in 1881-2, were largely derived from Godwin, it may be noted.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Shaw turned again to commercial work it was to design in 1881 the offices for
the bankers Baring Brothers at 8 Bishopsgate in the City of London. This small building
was as discreet, as orderly, and almost as domestic as Cheyne House. But the next year,
so chameleon-like was his development, he gave the more conspicuous Alliance Assurance
Building at the corner of St James’s Street and Pall Mall opposite St James’s Palace
broad, low, banded arches of brick and stone below and elaborated the vertical articulation
of the upper storeys with profuse sculptural ornament.<a id="r274"></a><a href='#f274' class='c025'><sup>[274]</sup></a> Very tall and scallopy
gables provide a Neo-Picturesque effect only too comparable to the most vulgar ‘Pont
Street Dutch’ houses designed by his rivals or even to contemporary Northern Renaissance
work on the Continent. To emphasize his variousness further, there is diagonally
across the street a later edifice for the same clients, built in collaboration with his pupil
Ernest Newton (1856-1922) in 1903, so quietly academic in the Neo-Georgian taste of
the early twentieth century that one can hardly believe it is also Shaw’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>His next important secular works after the first Alliance building, both begun in 1887
like the Latimer Road church, contrast with each other almost as markedly as they do
with that. Characteristic of the essentially private patronage—patronage from successful
artists, patronage from business, patronage from the professional classes—responsible for
the best English architecture of this period is the fact that Shaw’s first public commission
came only at this advanced stage of his career. London’s Metropolitan Police Offices in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>New Scotland Yard, of which the original block was built in 1887-8 and the second
block to the south added in 1890, have a splendid site on the Thames Embankment.
Remembering, it would seem almost for the first time, his own Scottish birth—or possibly
in apposite reference to the familiar name of the London police headquarters—Shaw
designed Scotland Yard somewhat like a Scottish castle with corner tourelles and
tall curved gables, but using throughout heavy and rather academic later seventeenth-century
detailing of a much less regional sort (Plate <a href='#pl106b'>106<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Red brick and stone in
combination make it also as colouristic as the Alliance building, the solidity of the
proportions makes it weighty, and the high gables and tower roofs give it great variety
of outline. As a result, the total effect is almost High Victorian in its vigour and its
massiveness. Shaw is said to have regretted the need to build a second block; certainly it
must have been more impressive when the original block stood alone like an isolated
riverside fortress.</p>

<p class='c010'>Scotland Yard seems to look backward somewhat, at least in relation to that gradual
development towards orderliness and restraint of an eighteenth-century sort which can
be discerned in Shaw’s work of the seventies despite all its variousness. On the other
hand, the house that he built in 1887-8 for Fred White,<a id="r275"></a><a href='#f275' class='c025'><sup>[275]</sup></a> an American diplomat, at 170
Queen’s Gate, so near to that strikingly aberrant terrace house of the previous decade at
No. 196, seems to look forward into the early twentieth century, when the eighteenth-century
Georgian would provide the basis for a quite archaeological revival. This plain
rectangular block of red brick, orderly and symmetrical on the long façade towards
Imperial Institute Road and also on the end towards Queen’s Gate, with three ranges
of large sash-windows below an academic cornice, is therefore as much a historical
landmark, if not an original creation, as was Glen Andred twenty years
before (Plate #105:pl105).
The suave and well-scaled ornamentation is concentrated at the doorway in the
eighteenth-century manner, and the hip roof is unbroken except by regularly spaced
dormers. Yet, curiously enough, the plan is somewhat less completely regular and symmetrical
than one might expect from the exterior; for example, the large drawing-room
towards Queen’s Gate is
<span class="sans">L</span>-shaped.</p>

<p class='c010'>Only the excellence of the craftsmanship here, based not on the Sussex vernacular but
on the most sophisticated work of around 1720, the prominence of the tall chimneys,
and the wide central dormer with its curved top reveal Shaw’s hand and suggest, perhaps,
an early date; otherwise such a house might well have been built forty years or so
later by many other architects, English and American (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>). However,
Webb at Smeaton Manor<a id="r276"></a><a href='#f276' class='c025'><sup>[276]</sup></a> in Yorkshire, built in 1877-9, had already arrived at an almost
identical regularity and formality of design (Plate <a href='#pl102a'>102<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Characteristically, however,
he did not elaborate the exterior with borrowed eighteenth-century detailing, and the
house remains almost undatable on internal evidence, like much of his best work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Scotland Yard is an all but unique example of an English public building of distinction
erected in the eighties. Before continuing with the account of Shaw’s work in the
nineties, two prominent features of the London skyline, the most striking additions
made since Butterfield’s spire of All Saints’ rose in Margaret Street in the fifties and the
Victoria Tower of the Houses of Parliament was completed in the sixties, should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>mentioned. Both the Imperial Institute, towering over Shaw’s contiguous Fred White
house in South Kensington, which was built in 1887-93 in honour of Queen Victoria’s
first jubilee, and the Catholic cathedral of Westminster, not begun until 1894, are
especially notable for their very tall dome-topped towers. The cathedral, which was designed
by J. F. Bentley (1839-1902), a pupil of Clutton, has also a magnificent domed
interior. The Institute, built by T. E. Collcutt (1840-1924), was perhaps of less over-all interest
but extremely refined and elegant in its detailing compared to the contemporary
work of George &amp; Peto, which it most closely resembles. Curiously enough, the very
underscaled membering and even so dainty a trick as the use of single courses of red
brick here and there in the stonework does not make the 280-foot tower petty. It may
be compared to its own very great advantage with Haller’s contemporary tower, in a
somewhat parallel Northern Renaissance vein, on the Hamburg Rathaus. Collcutt’s
own earlier tower on the Town Hall at Wakefield in Yorkshire of 1877-80 was less
successful than this London landmark, which has happily survived the rest of the building.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bentley’s tower has a similar silhouette, but is more boldly striated by broad bands of
brick and stone. The detail, partly Byzantine, partly Early Renaissance despite his distinguished
early career as a Late Victorian Gothic church architect, is, like Collcutt’s,
rather underscaled. This goes still further to prove the extent to which this period
in England saw all architecture, even that of cathedrals, in domestic terms. However,
well before Bentley began his cathedral—it is not even yet completed as regards the
internal decoration—Shaw had turned towards considerably more monumental forms
at Scotland Yard, and even to quite academic design.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Bryanston, a large country house in Dorset begun in 1889 for Lord Portman,
Shaw modelled the main block on Sir Roger Pratt’s Coleshill House of the mid seventeenth
century; the side wings here are quite Gibbsian. This is the earliest example of
what the English call ‘Monumental Queen Anne’—to distinguish this sort of work
henceforth from the freer and more vernacular Queen Anne of the seventies and eighties—and
the Americans ‘Georgian Revival’. Two years later Shaw built Chesters in Northumberland.
This mansion is equally academic, if less derivative from particular sources;
but it is also highly original in plan and conception. The composition of the incurved
façade planes, moreover, is as knowing and as ingenious in its formal way as anything
he ever built in a more rambling vein.</p>

<p class='c010'>Later in the nineties Shaw’s stylistic uncertainty—or, if one wishes to call it so, his
versatility—was notably illustrated in two large commercial buildings built in Liverpool.
The façade of Parr’s Bank in Castle Street, built in 1898 in collaboration with
W. E. Willink (1856-1924) and P. C. Thicknesse (1860-1920), is of the suavest academic
order. Its proportions are surer than in any of his other works except Chesters, and yet he
striated its light-coloured stonework with bands of green marble in a way few later architects
working in this vein would ever have thought of doing. Two years later, in the
offices that he built in collaboration with Doyle for Ismay, Imrie &amp; Co., later the White
Star Line—for whom he also designed the interiors of the liner <i>Oceanic</i>—he provided
what was externally almost a copy of Scotland Yard, and yet inside he exposed the
riveted metal structural members in a fashion at once frank and highly decorative.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>If Shaw had had the opportunity to rebuild Nash’s Regent Street Quadrant completely
according to the designs that he prepared in 1905 the loss of the original work
might not be so serious. Approaching seventy-five, he turned here to a Piranesian
Classicism. The colonnaded section finished in 1908, which forms the northern front of
the Piccadilly Hotel, though flanked at both ends by an emasculated version of Shaw’s
design carried out in 1923 by his disciple and biographer Sir Reginald Blomfield (1856-1942),
rivals in boldness anything English architecture had produced since the days of
Vanbrugh and Hawksmore. Even more spectacular, and also incomplete, since the gable
at the east end was never built, is the Piccadilly façade of the hotel with its tremendous
open colonnade raised high against the sky (Plate <a href='#pl107'>107</a>). The Classical serenity of this
feature is characteristically contrasted with the voluted silhouette of the tall gable over
the projecting wing at the west end, and the exuberance of the whole puts most other
Edwardian Neo-Baroque to shame.</p>

<p class='c010'>To summarize Shaw’s achievement or even to epitomize his personal style is almost
impossible. He was, for example, in no ordinary sense of the word merely an eclectic;
yet his modes were very various, more various than those of almost any other nineteenth-century
architect of equal rank. After his first borrowings from Nesfield, however,
they were all his own—his own, at least, until hordes of other architects in England
and America took them up, one or two at a time, often vulgarizing them beyond recognition.
He was probably not the most talented English architect of his generation and
certainly not the most original. How much he owed to Nesfield at the start it is impossible
to estimate, even though at least two of the characteristic Shavian modes seem
to have been originally of his invention—if not, indeed, of Devey’s!</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet ironically Nesfield’s own later work appeared to contemporaries almost like an
echo of Shaw’s if it was known at all. He never had any such success as did Shaw, and
died relatively young in 1888. Godwin also was somehow never able, after 1870, to repeat
the public triumphs that had been his in the competitions of the early sixties. In his
later life he turned more and more to designing sets and costumes for the theatre and
died in 1886, two years before Nesfield. Webb lived on till 1915, although he retired
from practice in 1900; his spirit, moreover, lived on in a quite different way from
Shaw’s. It was through emulation of the craftsman-like integrity of Webb’s work that
the attitudes, rather than the forms, of Pugin’s earlier Gothic Revival were transmitted
to the first modern architects quite as much as through study of the writings of his friend
and close associate Morris.</p>

  <h2 id='ch13' class='c013'><span class='c027'>CHAPTER 13</span><br />H. H. RICHARDSON AND McKIM, MEAD &amp; WHITE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> story of Shaw’s career is a fascinating one, far more interesting in fact than the
general history of English architecture in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. It
was a success-drama in four or five acts, of which the last was by no means the least brilliant.
Richardson’s career was less eventful, even though, at its peak in the mid eighties,
it was at least as successful as Shaw’s. It was also incomplete, since death brought his
production to an end at that peak when he was only forty-eight. Yet Richardson’s
achievement must be considered greater than Shaw’s, qualitatively if not quantitatively,
because his work was better integrated and his development more intelligently directed.
Moreover, his influence operated on two levels: on one it was as wide, if more evanescent,
than Shaw’s—say, what Shaw’s might have been if <i>he</i> had died at the age of
forty-eight, that is, in 1879—on another level it was more like that of Webb, affecting
deeply several of the most creative American architects of the next two generations.</p>
<p class='c010'>Henry Hobson Richardson was born in 1838 near New Orleans in Louisiana. Upon
graduation from Harvard in 1858 Richardson, bilingual on account of his Louisiana
birth, not unnaturally proceeded to Paris to the École des Beaux-Arts, entering there the
atelier of L.-J. André (1819-90), a pupil of Lebas who had become a professor at the
École in 1855. But after two years the outbreak of the Civil War in the United States
cut off his remittances from home and he had to find work in order to maintain himself.
His experience in the office of Théodore Labrouste, notably in working on the designs
for the Asile d’Ivry outside Paris, was perhaps of more ultimate value to him than what
he learned in André’s atelier and at the École. Several of his earliest works in America,
designed immediately after his return from Paris in 1865, have been discussed already
(see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>). It was with the Brattle Square (now First Baptist) Church on Commonwealth
Avenue at Clarendon Street in the new Back Bay residential district of Boston,
the commission for which he won in a competition held in 1870, that his career seriously
began. During the years that this was in construction, 1871-2, he had in his office a
young assistant, Charles F. McKim (1847-1909), who had returned from Paris at the outbreak
of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. It may well be that the forceful McKim
helped Richardson to crystallize the divergent elements evident in his earlier work into
a coherent personal style. The Brattle Square Church somewhat resembles in its round-arched
medievalism such a Paris church of the sixties as Vaudremer’s Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge,
which Richardson himself may have seen and admired in the early stages of
its construction. But the squarish
<span class="sans">T</span>-shaped
plan, without aisles but with transepts, would
have been as unusual in France at this period as in England. The material is the richly
textured Roxbury Puddingstone rising in broad plain surfaces to the medium-pitched
gables. The detail strikes a sort of balance between the French Romanesquoid and the
English High Victorian Gothic, the forms being more French, the execution more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>English. The varied polychromy of the deep voussoirs of the arches is certainly English,
but with a personal note in the great variety of the coloured banding. The corner placing
of the tall tower, with its fine frieze by the French sculptor Bartholdi, is English in
spirit, but its shape is rather more campanile-like than any English church tower had
been since the forties.</p>

<p class='c010'>A similar stylistic crystallization can be seen in the very extensive plant of the State
Hospital at Buffalo, N.Y., a commission also won by Richardson in competition in 1870.
This was largely re-designed before construction began in 1872 and was in building
throughout the whole decade. It was, functionally, the sort of commission for which
Richardson’s French training best prepared him, and the planning is French. The other
sources of the design seem to have been mostly English, particularly the projects of
Burges.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two buildings in Springfield, Mass., where Richardson had been working on and off
since his return from Paris, are even more significant than the Buffalo asylum for
the rather definite evidence they offer as to his chief contemporary sources of inspiration
at this point. The spire of the North Congregational Church there—commissioned as
early as 1868, but built in 1872-3, after being re-designed in 1871 or 72—is a rather squat
pyramid of quarry-faced brownstone with four corner spirelets rising from the same
square base, apparently a version of the spire Burges designed for his Skelton church
begun in 1871 or that of Street’s St James the Less. The tower of the Hampden County
Courthouse of 1871-3 also comes from Burges, in this case from the project that he
entered in the London Law Courts competition of 1866. The general composition owes
more to the slightly earlier English town halls at Northampton and Congleton by
Godwin, who was also Burges’s collaborator on the Law Courts project. But the magnificent
scale of the random ashlar walls of quarry-faced Monson granite, their coldness
relieved by bright red pointing, is as personal to Richardson as the similar brownstone
masonry of the North Church and the Buffalo Hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>Richardson’s American Express Building,<a id="r277"></a><a href='#f277' class='c025'><sup>[277]</sup></a> his first work in Chicago, which was begun
in 1872, and his contemporary Andrews house in Newport, R.I., both showed comparable
evidence of generic influence from contemporary England
(see Chapters <a href='#ch14'>14</a> and 15:ch15#).
In this same year, 1872, Richardson won the competition for Trinity Church<a id="r278"></a><a href='#f278' class='c025'><sup>[278]</sup></a> in
Boston, which was to occupy a conspicuous site on the east side of Copley Square, the
principal open space in the new Back Bay district. Preceding by a year the Panic of 1873,
which slowed building almost to a standstill, this commission and that for the Buffalo
Hospital kept him busy through five lean years. As Trinity rose to completion over the
years 1873-7, this big Boston church established Richardson’s reputation as the new
leader among American architects (Plate <a href='#pl108a'>108<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Even before Trinity was finished others
were producing crude imitations of it; and over the next twenty years many prominent
American churches, particularly in the Middle West, followed in some degree the
paradigm that it provided.</p>

<p class='c010'>Trinity is in plan an enlarged and modified version of the Brattle Square Church. A
deep semicircular chancel provides a fourth arm, and a great square lantern rises over the
crossing. The elaborate porch, so archaeologically Provençal Romanesque, was added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>by Richardson’s successors, Shepley, Rutan &amp; Coolidge, in the nineties, as were also the
tops of the western towers; the present decorations of the chancel are much later and by
Charles D. Maginnis (1867-1955).</p>

<p class='c010'>The materials of Trinity are pink Milford granite in quarry-faced random ashlar for the
walling and the Longmeadow brownstone that he had first used on the Unity Church in
Springfield for the profuse trim. The detail changed in character as the work proceeded;
in the earliest portions executed it is heavy and crude, with the foliage carved in a
naturalistic High Victorian Gothic vein. But the logic of the round arches that Richardson
had been consistently using since he designed the Brattle Square Church in 1870 led
him to study Révoil’s <i>Architecture romane du midi de la France</i>,<a id="r279"></a><a href='#f279' class='c025'><sup>[279]</sup></a> and such a characteristic
feature as the polychromy on the outside of the apse is specifically Auvergnat.
Moreover, the executed lantern was rather closely based on that of the Old Cathedral of
Salamanca in Spain—a model that Richardson’s assistant Stanford White (1853-1906),
who succeeded McKim in his employ in 1872, seems to have suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most contemporaries, supposing all worthy nineteenth-century architecture to be
necessarily derivative from this or that style of the past, believed that Richardson had
initiated a Romanesque Revival here. But Richardson remained really as responsive
to contemporary English ideas as he had been earlier. For example, the curious double-curved
wooden roof with kingpost trusses derives from published examples of similar
roofs built or projected by Burges. Equally symptomatic of English influence is the use
of stained glass by Morris and Burne-Jones in the north transept windows. That glass,
however, is inferior in richness of tone to the small windows in the west front designed
by the American artist John LaFarge. LaFarge was also responsible for the painted
decoration on the walls and the roofs.</p>

<p class='c010'>To take over Fuller &amp; Laver’s New York State Capitol at Albany when already partly
built in the way that Richardson and Eidlitz—a foreign-born exponent of Romanesque
of the earlier <i>Rundbogenstil</i> sort, it will be recalled—were asked to do in 1875 was a
thankless job; but this call for Richardson’s aid illustrates the rapidity with which he
achieved a national reputation. More important, both historically and intrinsically, than
what he was able to carry out in Albany—chiefly the Senate Chamber—were a second
house that he built in Shepard Avenue in Newport, R.I., in 1874-6 and a building in
Main Street in Hartford, Conn., of 1875-6 (see Chapters <a href='#ch14'>14</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). The Sherman
house is the first example of a Shavian manor successfully translated into American
materials; the Cheney Block (now Brown-Thompson Store) is not Shavian at all, but
very similar to the arcaded façades common in England since the late fifties (Plate <a href='#pl116a'>116<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>To the late seventies belong two remarkably fine buildings, still obviously related to
slightly earlier English work, but more personal than either the Newport house or the
Hartford commercial building. With the Winn Memorial Library in Woburn, Mass.,
of 1877-8 Richardson initiated a line of small-town public libraries that reached its
climax in the Crane Library in Quincy, Mass., of 1880-3 (Plate <a href='#pl110'>110</a>). The high
window-bands of the stack wings, a monumental stone version of Shaw’s ‘ribbon-windows’,
and the stone-mullioned ‘window-walls’ at the ends are more significant
than the round stair-turrets and the cavernous entrance arches—Early Christian from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Syria<a id="r280"></a><a href='#f280' class='c025'><sup>[280]</sup></a> in origin, not Southern French Romanesque, it should be noted—that romanticize
their generally compact massing. The highly functional planning is asymmetrical
yet very carefully ordered, perhaps the one remaining trace of his Paris training.</p>

<p class='c010'>In building Sever Hall, a classroom building for Harvard College in Cambridge,
Mass., in 1878-80 Richardson abandoned rock-faced granite and brownstone, materials
whose common use would, a little later, mark the extent of his influence on other
architects, for the red brick of the nearby eighteenth-century buildings in the old Harvard
Yard. He even imitated the plain oblong masses of these Georgian edifices under
his great red-tiled hip-roof; but the front, with its deep Syrian arch and two tower-like
rounded bays, and the rear, with a broader and shallower central bow, are wholly
Richardsonian. There is a rather Shavian pediment over the centre of the front, however;
while the moulded brick mullions of the banked windows and the very rich cut-brick
panels of floral ornament seem to reflect current English work by Stevenson and by
Godwin as well as by Shaw. Yet the whole has been amalgamated into a composition
quite as orderly as anything the English ‘Annites’ had produced. At the same time
Sever Hall is almost as vigorous and manly in scale as his contemporary libraries of
granite and brownstone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two domestic buildings of 1880, one entirely shingled, the other of rough glacial
boulders, are even more personal works; and both, particularly the former, represent the
American domestic mode of this period now called the ‘Shingle Style’ (see Chapter
15). The John Bryant house in Cohasset, Mass., of 1880 first illustrated his emancipation
from the direct Shavian imitation that had begun with the Sherman house and
continued in several projects—probably mostly White’s work in actual fact—that were
prepared in the later seventies but never executed. Quite a series of later shingled
houses by Richardson followed the Bryant house between 1881 and 1886 (Plate <a href='#pl124b'>124<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The contemporary Ames Gate Lodge<a id="r281"></a><a href='#f281' class='c025'><sup>[281]</sup></a> in North Easton, Mass., has a sort of antediluvian
power in the bold plasticity of its boulder-built walls—a theme exploited once
before in Grace Church in Medford, Mass., of 1867 it will be recalled—as remote from
the Romanesque as from the Queen Anne. A similarly absolute originality of a more
gracious order can be seen in the Fenway Bridge of 1880-1 in Boston; its tawny seam-faced
granite walls happily echo the easy naturalistic curves of the landscaping by his
friend F. L. Olmsted (1822-1903),<a id="r282"></a><a href='#f282' class='c025'><sup>[282]</sup></a> of which it is a principal feature.</p>

<p class='c010'>1881 saw the initiation of a more monumental building for Harvard, Austin Hall,<a id="r283"></a><a href='#f283' class='c025'><sup>[283]</sup></a>
then the Law School, which was completed in 1883. Rich Auvergnat polychromy and a
great deal of rather Byzantinesque carved ornament somewhat confuse the direct structural
expressiveness of the thoroughly articulated masonry walls; as a result Austin Hall
provided a multitude of decorative clichés for imitators to abuse. Much more modest
and also much more significant was the station at Auburndale, Mass., also of 1881, built
for the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad. This was the first and the finest of a series of small
suburban stations notable for the simplicity of their design and for the compositional
skill with which the open elements, carried on sturdy but gracefully shaped wooden
supports, were related to the solid masonry blocks of granite and brownstone beneath
sweeping roofs of tile or slate. If Shaw was called on in the nineties to design the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>interiors of an ocean liner for the White Star Line, Richardson had already provided in
1884 a railway carriage for the Boston &amp; Albany. This was neither Romanesque nor
Queen Anne in inspiration, but had domestically scaled interiors lined with small square
oaken panels and no carved ornament of any sort.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stations, libraries, and houses form the bulk of Richardson’s production from 1882
until his death. But two much larger buildings, which he himself judged to be his master
works, were also fortunately initiated, one in 1884 and the other in 1885, well before his
last illness began, though both had to be finished by his successors Shepley, Rutan &amp;
Coolidge after his death. The Allegheny County Buildings<a id="r284"></a><a href='#f284' class='c025'><sup>[284]</sup></a> in Pittsburgh, Penna., consist
of a vast quadrangular courthouse dominated by a very tall tower that rises in the
centre of the front and a gaol across the street to the rear. Except for the courtyard
walls, interesting for the variety and the openness of their ranges of granite arcading, the
courthouse offers on the whole only a sort of summary of his talents; the detail, above
all, is afflicted with an archaeological dryness that must be due to the increasing dependence
of his assistants on published documents of medieval carving. The courthouse
provided, however, the model for many large public buildings in the next few years.
Among these, the City Hall in Minneapolis, Minn., begun by the local firm of Long &amp;
Kees in 1887, is not unworthy of comparison with the original, particularly as regards
the tower. That of Toronto in Canada, built by E. J. Lennox in 1890-9, is less interesting
but even more monumental; it also signalizes the supersession of English by American
influence in Canadian architecture at this point, as does the almost equally Richardsonian
Windsor Station in Montreal begun by the American architect Bruce Price in 1888.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Pittsburgh Jail is a masterpiece of the most personal order, Piranesian in scale,
nobly expressive of its gloomy purpose, and as superb an example of granite masonry as
exists in the world (Plate <a href='#pl108b'>108<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). It epitomizes Richardson’s genius where the courthouse
merely summarizes his talents.</p>

<p class='c010'>Richardson’s highest achievement, however, was in the field of private building not
in that of the public monument. By a happy coincidence his ultimate masterpiece rose
in Chicago where, at this very moment, technical advances in construction were being
made that would soon bring to a climax the whole story of nineteenth-century commercial
architecture (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). Chicago retains Richardson’s last great masonry
house, that of 1885-7 for J. J. Glessner, almost as perfect a domestic paradigm of granite
construction as the Pittsburgh Jail. To her shame, however, Richardson’s Marshall
Field Wholesale Store, built during the same years, was torn down a generation ago to
provide a car park.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Field store occupied an entire block with a dignity and a grandeur no other commercial
structure had ever attained before (Plate <a href='#pl116b'>116<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Internally it was of iron-skeleton
construction; externally the arcaded masonry walls represented a development from
those of the Cheney Building of ten years earlier (Plate <a href='#pl116a'>116<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Segmental arches covered
the broad low openings in the massive ground storey, all built of great ashlar blocks of
rock-faced red Missouri granite. The next three storeys, built of brownstone, were
combined under a single range of broad arches, yet also articulated within these
arched openings by stone mullions and transoms. Above this stage the rhythm doubled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>with the windows of the next two storeys joined vertically under narrower arches. The
scale of the quarry-faced ashlar was graded down as the walls rose, quite as were the window
sizes, and the non-supporting spandrels were filled with small square blocks. The
full thickness of the bearing masonry walls was revealed at all the openings. Finally there
came a trabeated attic of somewhat Schinkel-like character over which appeared almost
the only carved detail on the building, a boldly crocketed cornice. That was ‘Early
French’, i.e., of twelfth-century Gothic rather than Romanesque or Byzantine inspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>The result was a monument as bold and almost as Piranesian in its scale and its forcefulness
as the Pittsburgh Jail; but the walls were also as open, as continuously fenestrated,
as those of the court of the Pittsburgh Courthouse. The logical and expressive
design of commercial buildings with walls of bearing masonry could hardly be carried
further. But in the very year that the Field Store was finished Holabird &amp; Roche, in
designing the Tacoma Building, also in Chicago, first showed how the exterior of such
edifices might express instead a newly developed sort of construction that allowed the
internal metal skeleton to carry the external cladding of masonry (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In one last commercial building, much more obscurely located and built of far less
sumptuous materials, which was started just before Richardson’s death—it was only
commissioned after his last illness had begun—he carried the logic of the design of the
Field Store one step farther. It was almost as if he had already sensed, like Holabird &amp;
Roche, the implications of the Home Insurance Building in Chicago of 1883-5 by their
former employer William Le Baron Jenney, in which the new sort of construction was
first used but not at all expressed. On Richardson’s Ames Building in Harrison Avenue
in Boston a tall arcade rose almost the full height of the wall beneath a machicolated
attic; the depth of the reveals around the sash at the sides of the brick piers was
minimized; and above the ground storey the spandrels were of metal panels set almost
flush with both piers and sash.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Richardson died in 1886 the evidence of his great late works indicates that his
powers were at their highest. His office, moreover, had never been busier. How Richardson
might have developed further it is impossible to say. In the hands of his imitators
the Richardsonian mode did not grow in any very creative way during the decade
or more that it continued a favourite for churches, public buildings, and even houses
built of masonry. Those who had been closest to Richardson when his style was
maturing, McKim and White, rarely imitated him; even before his death, in fact, they
had already set under way a reaction against the Richardsonian. Their buildings and not
his provide the real American analogue to the later work of Shaw in England. Moreover,
their leadership succeeded his in many professional circles from coast to coast
almost before he was dead.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaving aside the modes inherited from the sixties, in any case transmuted almost beyond
recognition by the early eighties if not yet entirely superseded, there were at the
time of Richardson’s death three main currents in American architecture as against the
four or five more or less Shavian modes then popular in England. One was the Richardsonian.<a id="r285"></a><a href='#f285' class='c025'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
This was practised with some success by various Boston firms such as Peabody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>&amp; Stearns and Van Brunt &amp; Howe. It had been carried to Kansas City, Missouri, by Van
Brunt, moreover, and it was being developed with some originality by other Middle
Westerners such as George D. Mason (1856-1948) in Detroit, D. H. Burnham (1846-1912)
and his partner J. W. Root (1850-91), H. I. Cobb (1859-1931) and his partner
Frost, and several other firms in Chicago. The very able designer Harvey Ellis (1852-1904),<a id="r286"></a><a href='#f286' class='c025'><sup>[286]</sup></a>
working for L. S. Buffington (1848?-1931) in Minneapolis, should also be mentioned.
Another current was represented by the development leading towards the
Chicago skyscrapers of the nineties, in Richardson’s last years more in the hands of
technicians than of architects (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The third, and for the next few years the most expansive, current was what can
already be called the Academic Reaction. This was parallel to, yet already pushing well
ahead of, Shaw’s somewhat coy approach to a programmatic revival of eighteenth-century
forms; and McKim, Mead &amp; White were its acknowledged leaders.<a id="r287"></a><a href='#f287' class='c025'><sup>[287]</sup></a> During
the years that White was working for Richardson he seems to have been devotedly
Shavian. Certain unexecuted house projects from the Richardson office which White
signed, done for the Cheney family of Manchester, Conn., the clients for Richardson’s
Cheney Block in Hartford, make this particularly evident. When White replaced
Bigelow in the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; Bigelow, on his return from the European trip
that he took after leaving Richardson in 1878, he found McKim designing Shavian
houses with a considerably less sure decorative touch than his own. The McKim,
Mead &amp; White country houses that followed, however, such as that for H. Victor
Newcomb in Elberon, N.J., of 1880-1 (Plate <a href='#pl125a'>125<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), that for Isaac Bell, Jr, in Newport,
R.I., of 1881-2 (Plate <a href='#pl126'>126</a>), and that for Cyrus McCormick in Richfield Springs, N.Y.,
of the same years, represent in several ways a real advance over Richardson’s Sherman
house.<a id="r288"></a><a href='#f288' class='c025'><sup>[288]</sup></a> Such an advance is equally to be observed in various houses built around Boston
in these years by W. R. Emerson (1833-1918) and by Arthur Little (1852-1925), the
very earliest of which doubtless influenced Richardson when he designed the Bryant
house (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>For McKim, Mead &amp; White’s Tiffany house in New York of 1882-3, all of tawny
‘Roman’ brick with much moulded brick detail, the inspiration was largely Shavian
also; only the rock-faced stone base and the broad low entrance arch were at all Richardsonian.
In the New York house that they began the next year, however—really a group
of houses arranged in a
<span class="sans">U</span> around
an open court across Madison Avenue from the rear of St Patrick’s
Cathedral—for the railway magnate Henry Villard an entirely different,
even quite opposed, spirit appears (Plate <a href='#pl109b'>109<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The
Villard houses, although on Villard’s insistence still built of
brownstone rather than of light-coloured limestone, are as much a High
Renaissance Italian <i>palazzo</i> as anything Barry or his
contemporaries on the Continent ever designed in the preceding sixty
years. Reputedly Joseph M. Wells (1853-90), an assistant in the McKim,
Mead &amp; White office who later refused membership in the firm, was
responsible for the decision to follow Roman models of around 1500,
most notably the Cancelleria Palace, as that was known to him—he had
never been abroad—through the plates of Letarouilly’s <i>Édifices de
Rome moderne</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This type of design represented a conscious reaction against the Neo-Picturesque,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>whether Richardsonian, Shavian, or <i>François I</i>, a return to formal order of the most
drastic sort. It represented also a return to close archaeological imitation of a style from
the past such as had ended in America, on the whole, with the decline of the Greek
Revival a generation earlier. Curiously enough this turn was also something of a declaration
of independence from Europe, since the American Academic Reaction as initiated
in the design of the Villard houses seems to have had no contemporary sources abroad.
However much Shaw’s Queen Anne had, for about a decade, been moving towards an
equivalent formality—of a more eighteenth-century sort—Shaw had neither gone as yet
so far in this direction nor did he ever turn to the High Renaissance for his models. Continental
parallels in the eighties are not hard to find in the work of such men as Balat in
Belgium, Koch in Italy, and Wagner in Austria; but their current production was
probably not known in the United States, whose foreign relations in architecture had
always been largely restricted to England, France, and Germany.</p>

<p class='c010'>This American return to order was at first more significant for its absolute aspect than
for its archaeological bent. Although McKim, Mead &amp; White used a Renaissance arcade
at the base of their Goelet Building erected in Broadway at 20th Street in New York in
1885-6, the upper storeys of this modest skyscraper offer a very free, and at the same
time a highly regularized, expression of the hive of offices behind, and even of the metal
grid of the internal skeleton. Certain houses by McKim, Mead &amp; White in New York
of these years were even freer from the imitation of specific Italian precedents; while
their Wm. G. Low house of as late as 1886-7, on the seashore south of Bristol, R.I., is a
masterpiece of the ‘Shingle Style’ despite the tightness and formality of its plan (see
Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). Carefully ordered under its single broad gable, which even subsumes the
veranda at the southern end, the Low house is yet quite without reminiscent detail or,
indeed, much of any detail at all (Plate <a href='#pl127'>127</a>). In a group of small houses at Tuxedo Park,
not at all academic in their exterior treatment, Bruce Price (1845-1903) was reorganizing
the open plan of the Americanized Queen Anne in a schematically symmetrical way
at just this time also (Plate <a href='#pl125b'>125<span class='fss'>B</span></a>; Figure 28).</p>

<p class='c010'>The possibility of a revival of the American Colonial and Post-Colonial in all their
successive phases from the medievalism of the seventeenth-century origins to what can
be called the ‘Carpenters’ Adam’ of 1800 had been in the air ever since the early seventies,
when McKim had added a Neo-Colonial room to a real Colonial house in Newport, R.I.
In the local Colonial architecture Americans found obvious parallels to the seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century precedent that Shaw was exploiting in England.<a id="r289"></a><a href='#f289' class='c025'><sup>[289]</sup></a> The ‘Shingle
Style’ employed various features and treatments—such as the all-over covering of
shingles itself—that recall American work of the periods before 1800. But because of the
continued strength of inherited Picturesque ideals there was no programmatic imitation
of formal eighteenth-century house design before the mid eighties. Even such a highly
orderly example as Little’s Shingleside House at Swampscott, Mass., of 1880-1 was still
quite un-archaeological. Interestingly enough, this seems to have been about the first up-to-date
American house to be published in a foreign magazine<a id="r290"></a><a href='#f290' class='c025'><sup>[290]</sup></a> since the <i>Allgemeine
Bauzeitung</i> in 1846 presented examples of Greek Revival terrace-houses in New York.</p>

<p class='c010'>Following on the completion of the Bramantesque Villard houses in New York in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>1885, McKim, Mead &amp; White built in Newport, R.I., in 1885-6 the H. A. C. Taylor
house, lately destroyed, which was as Neo-Georgian, in its American Colonial way, as
the Fred White house Shaw began in London two years later. For this the American
architects adopted the symmetrical Anglo-Palladian plan of the mid eighteenth century
and capped the resultant rectangular mass with the special gable-over-hip roof of
Colonial Newport. Elaborately embellished with Palladian windows and with much
carved detail of a generically Georgian order, the Taylor house provided a new formula
of design for domestic work that soon superseded almost completely the ‘Shingle
Style’. From the Taylor house stems that mature Colonial Revival which was to last
longer in the end in America than had the Greek Revival.</p>

<p class='c010'>Down to the early nineties, however, McKim, Mead &amp; White were rarely so programmatic
in their Neo-Colonial work, and their principal public building of the late
eighties, the Boston Public Library, was entirely Italianate (Plate <a href='#pl111'>111</a>). In 1887 they were
commissioned to build this major monument on the west side of Copley Square. There
it was to face the Trinity Church that had initiated the Richardsonian wave more than
a decade earlier—a monument in whose designing, moreover, both McKim and White
had actually participated. The Library as built in 1888-92 was a major challenge to the
Richardsonian, at least as contemporaries then generally understood and employed what
they thought was Richardson’s mode. The contrast it offers to the church opposite is
almost as great as to the prominent but low-grade High Victorian Gothic structures
that flanked the new site to north and south, the New Old South Church by Cummings
&amp; Sears of the mid seventies, still standing across Boylston Street, and the contemporaneous
Museum of Fine Arts by John H. Sturgis (?-1888) and Charles Brigham
(?-1925) which long occupied the south side of the square.</p>

<p class='c010'>Trinity is dark and rich in colour, a complex pile rising massively to its large central
lantern. Moreover, it was flanked at the left on the Boylston Street side, where Richardson
took Picturesque advantage of the corner cut off his site by Huntington Avenue,
with an asymmetrically organized and domestically scaled parish house. The Library is
light coloured and monochromatic, all of a smooth-cut Milford granite ashlar originally
almost white and even today much lighter than the rock-faced pink Milford granite of
Trinity. It is, moreover, a simple quadrangular mass, capped by a pantiled<a id="r291"></a><a href='#f291' class='c025'><sup>[291]</sup></a> hip-roof of
moderate height; the scale throughout is monumental and the detail sparse but eminently
suave. Yet if the contrast with Richardson’s Trinity of 1873-7 is so great—and even
greater with the ponderous vernacular Richardsonian as that was long illustrated south
of the Library in the all-brownstone S. S. Pierce Store just built by S. Edwin Tobey
in 1887—the continuity with Richardson’s work of the mid eighties is equally notable.</p>

<p class='c010'>For example, none of Richardson’s own late work was polychromatic. Three of his
more prominent edifices, the Allegheny County Buildings in Pittsburgh and the Glessner
and MacVeagh houses in Chicago, were all of light-coloured granite, while the
Warder house in Washington is of smooth-cut limestone such as Wells had wished to
use for the Villard houses. Above all, the quadrangular block of the Boston Library
with its regular arcuated fenestration parallels rather closely the design of Richardson’s
just completed masterpiece, the Marshall Field Store. Thus, in fact, Richardson’s former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>assistants, for all the Renaissance precedent of their detailing—and the courtyard of
tawny Roman brick is almost more Bramantesque in treatment than the Villard houses—were
to a very notable extent only proceeding farther in a direction that he himself had
already taken.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since most contemporaries, in their innocence, thought the Richardsonian merely a
Romanesque Revival, it is understandable that they saw in such things as the Villard
houses and the Boston Public Library an alternative—and anti-Richardsonian—Renaissance
Revival. Nor can it be denied that the handling of the exterior of the
Library derives from the sides of Alberti’s Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini almost as
directly as the arcade in the court is copied from that of the Cancelleria Palace in Rome.<a id="r292"></a><a href='#f292' class='c025'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The stair-hall, the reading-room, and even the minor corridors reveal clearly their
Letarouillian origins when they are studied in the architects’ drawings, drawings which
imitate the very style of draughtsmanship of Letarouilly’s plates. The stair-hall, executed
in yellow Siena marble, has walls decorated allegorically by the French painter Puvis de
Chavannes, generally considered the greatest muralist of the age; the delivery room
has an entirely different sort of illustrative Shakespearean frieze painted by Edwin A.
Abbey; the hall in the top storey contains John Singer Sargent’s most ambitious murals.
The associated sculpture by Augustus St Gaudens and others is less interesting; but these
notable decorative increments from the hands of painters and sculptors of considerable
reputation help to explain why for a generation this building was thought to have
initiated a real ‘American Renaissance’ in which all the arts participated. Of this ‘Renaissance’
an international exhibition represented the moment of early triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>When, in 1891, it was decided to hold in Chicago the first American international
exhibition in recognition of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by
Columbus, the initial architectural responsibility lay with the Chicago firm of Burnham
&amp; Root. They were working at that very moment on two of the most remarkable of
early Chicago skyscrapers, the Reliance Building (Plate <a href='#pl115b'>115<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) begun in 1890, which
eventually offered the frankest expression of the new all-skeleton construction, and the
Monadnock Building begun the next year, which was the last very tall building to have
exterior walls of bearing masonry (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). The more representational Chicago
skyscrapers of this period by Burnham &amp; Root, the Women’s Temple and the Masonic
Building, were of generically Richardsonian character; and Richardsonian influence was
never stronger and more general in Chicago than in the five years following his death.
But the principal buildings of the World’s Columbian Exposition,<a id="r293"></a><a href='#f293' class='c025'><sup>[293]</sup></a> as they rose in
1892-3, proved to be neither Richardsonian nor at all expressive of metal construction in
the way of those at the Paris Exhibitions of 1878 and 1889 (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Burnham in 1891 called in various leading Eastern architects to assist him in designing
the World’s Fair, as the Chicago exhibition was usually called. Then in that same year
his partner Root, the designer of the pair, died. So it came about that the Easterners, not
so much the ageing Hunt, dean of the profession, as the energetic and executive McKim,
called the tune; McKim even provided Burnham with a new designer in the person of
Charles B. Atwood (1849-95) to replace Root. The Fair, with the landscape architect
Olmsted to collaborate on the planning, came out a great ‘White City’, the most complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>new urbanistic concept<a id="r294"></a><a href='#f294' class='c025'><sup>[294]</sup></a> to be realized since the replanning of Paris and of Vienna
in the third quarter of the century (Figure <a href='#i231'>20</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The metal-and-glass construction of the regular ranges of vast exhibition buildings
was almost entirely hidden by the elaborately columniated façades of white plaster that
were reflected, dream-like, in Olmsted’s formal lagoons. The architects’ inspiration was
generically academic, not specifically Italianate or Classical, and only one or two small
State pavilions followed Colonial Revival models. The dominant scale was very large
indeed, and the façades of the various buildings, although by many different architects
both Eastern and Western, were surprisingly harmonious. The young men back from
the École in Paris must have worked overtime to bring up to McKim’s increasingly
academic standards the projects of various well-established architects who had been
doing more or less Richardsonian work for the last decade.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the major importance of the Shavian influence in America around 1880, after
the designing of the Villard houses in 1883 American architects moved far more rapidly
than Shaw himself along the path towards abstract order and stylistic discipline. The
H. A. C. Taylor house introduced, in an American version, the formal eighteenth-century
revival—whether one calls it ‘Monumental Queen Anne’ or ‘Neo-Georgian’—before
Shaw began his house for Fred White. It is even perhaps significant that this was
done for an American client. The World’s Fair of the early nineties brought to the fore
a more Classical and ordered sort of Neo-Academicism than Shaw ever reached. By
the standards of the next generation, for example, Atwood’s Fine Arts Building at Chicago
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>(Plate <a href='#pl109a'>109<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), though based on a Prix de Rome project of 1857, was more advanced than
Shaw’s Piccadilly Hotel of 1905-8 (Plate <a href='#pl107'>107</a>). The Paris Exhibition of 1889 was notable
for its great feats of metal construction, Eiffel’s Tower (Plate <a href='#pl130a'>130<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) and Contamin’s
Galerie des Machines (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). But the façades of the Grand Palais built for the
Paris Exhibition of 1900, executed permanently in stone, seem merely a solider realization
of the plaster ‘dream-city’ that Burnham and McKim had conjured up on the
Chicago lake-front earlier in the decade.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether or not there was really influence from Chicago on Paris in the late
nineties, there can be no question that the influence of the Fair in America was very
great indeed. While the buildings of the Fair were rising in 1892 the young Frank
Lloyd Wright built his Blossom house in Chicago in rather obvious emulation of
McKim, Mead &amp; White’s Taylor house (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). The following year he submitted
in competition a completely academic project for a Museum and Library in
Milwaukee. Moreover, this project, based on Perrault’s east front of the Louvre, was
more suave in its academicism than the buildings that Richardson’s successors, Shepley,
Rutan &amp; Coolidge, who had already gone over like almost everyone else to the McKim
camp, were erecting that year for the Chicago Public Library and for the Chicago Art
Institute on Michigan Avenue.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the great historical paradox of this period in Chicago that at the very time the
academic triumph of the Fair was being prepared, nineteenth-century commercial
architecture was also reaching its climax there. Even before Richardson died, his tradition
had split in the mid eighties. One side of it, that related to his own French training
and his dependence on various styles of the past, limited though that was, as also his
growing concern with architectonic order, went forward under the leadership of
McKim (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>). The other side, derived from his sense of materials, at once
intelligent and intuitive, and his interest in functional expression—the qualities that
were most notable in his shingled houses and his commercial buildings—provided the
platform from which first Sullivan and then Wright in the late eighties and the nineties
advanced to the creation of the first modern architecture (see Chapters <a href='#ch14'>14</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>If the importance of Richardson and, indeed, that of Shaw—as regards the development
of domestic architecture—are to be fully appreciated the stories of the general development
of the commercial building and of the dwelling-house in England and America
down to 1900 must be known. Of the two, that of commercial architecture is the
simpler and also the more dramatic. The culmination of this story in the American skyscrapers
of the nineties has been recognized, from the time when so many foreign
visitors came to Chicago in 1893 on account of the Fair, as one of the major and most
characteristic architectural achievements of the whole period with which this volume
deals.</p>

  <h2 id='ch14' class='c013'><span class='c027'>CHAPTER 14</span><br />THE RISE OF COMMERCIAL ARCHITECTURE IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> line of technical development which runs from the cast-iron-framed textile mills
of the 1790s in England to the steel-framed skyscrapers of the 1890s in America seems to
posterity a simple and obvious one. But, in fact, various lags and cul-de-sacs make the
story long and complex. The most significant technical advances in iron construction
of the first half of the century were not in the commercial field, and the account in
this chapter is by no means merely a repetition and a continuation of the story of iron
construction down to 1855 that has been provided earlier (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>).</p>
<p class='c010'>The great difference between the Benyons, Marshall &amp; Bage mill of 1796 at Shrewsbury,
which initiated metal-skeleton structure, and Sullivan’s Guaranty Building in
Buffalo, N.Y., of a century later is that the English mill is purely and simply a technical
feat of construction quite without architectural pretension. If not literally anonymous,
the mill was certainly the work of a millwright rather than an architect; the skyscraper,
on the other hand, is a prime architectural monument of the long period of a century
and a half that this book covers, and the masterpiece of one of the greatest and most
creatively original designers that the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have produced
(Plate <a href='#pl119'>119</a>). But the skyscrapers of the 1890s do represent also the culmination of developments
in the field of construction that began with the English mills of the 1790s, even if
those developments are far from being the whole story of nineteenth-century commercial
architecture. How office buildings were gradually received into the realm of
architecture and, by the end of the nineteenth century, had risen so high in that realm
that few productions of the 1890s in other fields of building can compare in quality
of design with the great early skyscrapers is perhaps more significant for western
culture in general than the purely technical aspect of the story. The weaving together of
these two strands makes the full story one of the most interesting and complex in the
history of nineteenth-century architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nineteenth-century commercial building need not be very precisely defined. It includes
several slightly different sorts of edifices suitable for the needs of business, all consisting
of a succession of identical upper storeys subdivided into offices or storerooms,
with or without shops or representational premises below. Highly specialized and very
lucrative concerns such as banks and insurance companies, to whom prestige of various
sorts increasingly appeared a major desideratum, were the first to seek dignity and architectural
display by employing architects of established reputation. Such agencies also
desired buildings that were fire-resistant quite as much as did contemporary mill-owners.
Already in Soane’s earliest work at the Bank of England he emulated, as has been
noted, certain French technical advances that had just been employed by Louis in the
Théâtre Français in Paris before these advances were first adopted in an English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>textile mill (see Chapters <a href='#ch01'>1</a> and <a href='#ch07'>7</a>). Along Regent Street, around 1820, Nash and
others housed less pretentious types of business in structures of mixed character and of
less completely fireproof construction. But the premises on the ground floor here
generally required very wide shop-windows of the sort that the use of iron supports
made possible, even though the upper storeys were still nearly identical with those of
domestic terraces.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Boston in the mid twenties Parris was designing for the streets flanking his
Market Hall commercial façades of a much more novel character, using not iron but
granite in monolithic posts and lintels to provide a masonry skeleton filled with wide
and close-set windows in all the storeys (Plate <a href='#pl112b'>112<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).<a id="r295"></a><a href='#f295' class='c025'><sup>[295]</sup></a> In later Boston work of the
next two decades in this tradition architects such as Isaiah Rogers and various builders
employed iron for internal supports and sometimes also on the exterior at ground-floor
level. But the granite ‘skeleton’ front preceded the skeletonized all cast-iron front in
America by precisely a quarter of a century.</p>

<p class='c010'>In England in the forties complete internal skeletons of iron carrying jack arches
of brick or tile, hitherto used chiefly in textile mills, were increasingly adopted for
superior commercial work, but the characteristic exteriors of commercial buildings<a id="r296"></a><a href='#f296' class='c025'><sup>[296]</sup></a> remained
entirely of bearing masonry construction. However, in one case at least, a small
block at 50 Watling Street in London which was probably built before 1844, the iron
came through to the outer surface in the continuous window-bands of the upper
storeys, even though the corner piers and the sections of wall between the storeys were
of solid brickwork.</p>

<p class='c010'>From C. R. Cockerell, titular Architect of the Bank of England after Soane’s retirement
in 1833, and other architects such as Hopper, banks and insurance companies in
London and other large cities obtained in the thirties and forties distinguished buildings
all of masonry. In one especially fine edifice, erected in 1849-50 purely for use as offices,
Bank Chambers behind Cockerell’s monumental Branch Bank of England of 1845-8,
in Cook Street in Liverpool, he closely approached the directness of trabeated masonry
expression of the contemporary Boston architects and builders (Plate <a href='#pl112a'>112<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The fireproof
construction was of vaulted masonry throughout, moreover, with iron used only
for the skylights over the stair-wells.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the general character of commercial architecture down to the late fifties, however,
A. &amp; G. Williams’s Brunswick Buildings of 1841-2, also in Liverpool, were more
significant. In this very large quadrangular block of general offices they followed the
<i>palazzo</i> model provided by Barry’s newly completed Reform Club almost as closely as
George Alexander had already done in his Bath Savings Bank the year before. The
<i>palazzo</i> mode soon became the favourite one for imposing commercial architecture in
Britain and, before long, in the United States as well.<a id="r297"></a><a href='#f297' class='c025'><sup>[297]</sup></a> With its regular rows of good-sized
windows and its special prestige of having housed a commercial aristocracy in
Renaissance times, this had certain aspects of suitability, both real and symbolical, to the
needs of business-men. It also had serious disadvantages which soon led to a gradual
modulation away from the earlier formulas of design.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wide spacing of the windows demanded by correct <i>palazzo</i> precedent was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>awkward for offices requiring that maximum of natural light which was so readily
provided by Parris and others in their granite buildings in Boston and by the unknown
designer of 50 Watling Street in London. Therefore windows were soon much enlarged
and also set closer together. Sometimes, moreover, as in a large cotton warehouse built
in Parker Street in Manchester in 1850 by J. E. Gregan (1813-55), the increasingly heavy
frames were applied only to every other opening. Properly, such ‘palaces’ ought not to
be more than three storeys high, but the rapidly rising value of good sites in urban business
districts made it ever more desirable to carry office buildings to four and five
storeys like the terrace houses of the period.</p>

<p class='c010'>Already in the Sun Assurance Offices in Threadneedle Street in the City of London,
designed in 1839 and built in 1841-2, which do not in fact conform at all closely to the
standard <i>palazzo</i> formula, Cockerell not only opened the ground floor with an arcade
of haunched-segmental arches but also linked his two topmost floors behind an engaged
colonnade in order to reduce the apparent height of the façade to three storeys. Across
the street in the Royal Exchange Buildings of 1844-5 Edward l’Anson (1812-88) in
1844-5 lifted his whole palace front above a tall glazed arcade and tied the top-storey
windows into a sort of frieze as Barry had already done in the second storey of the Reform
Club (Plate <a href='#pl035b'>35<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). In Manchester l’Anson’s cousin Edward Walters (1808-72) in
the Silas Schwabe Building of 1845 at 41 Mosley Street linked the windows of the first
and second storeys by an applied arcade.</p>

<p class='c010'>The building with an exterior entirely of cast iron that James Bogardus (1800-74)
designed and built for his own use in New York in 1848-50 was well publicized at the
time,<a id="r298"></a><a href='#f298' class='c025'><sup>[298]</sup></a> and is still famous although long since demolished. On the corner of Washington
and Murray Streets in New York another Bogardus building, the Laing stores erected
in two months in 1849, is still extant (Plate <a href='#pl067b'>67<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Although there was never any such
general use of cast-iron fronts in Great Britain as in America in the fifties and sixties, it
seems probable from contemporary evidence that some architect, probably Owen Jones,
built one at 76 Oxford Street in London a year or so before 1851. However that may be,
an ironfounder named McConnel provided the structural elements for an office building
that still stands<a id="r299"></a><a href='#f299' class='c025'><sup>[299]</sup></a> in Jamaica Street, Glasgow, in 1855 with an exterior all of cast iron.
A curious feature of the design of this structure is the delicate iron membering that
forms a series of arcades between the major structural piers. This decorative device,
structurally meaningless in iron except for bracing although employed by Paxton at
the Crystal Palace, is probably an imitation of the masonry arcading that was, in the mid
fifties, gradually modifying the earlier <i>palazzo</i> paradigm quite beyond recognition.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1849 Wild used two ranges of Italian Gothic arcades on his St Martin’s Northern
Schools in London, and the perspicacious Street remarked in an article on the obvious
suitability of the theme for commercial fronts, as has already been noted. In Manchester
in 1851 Starkey &amp; Cuffley in a pair of shops employed ranges of three arches on each
of the two fronts in the four storeys, binding them in with coupled columns marking
the ends of the party walls.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lifting of the window tax in 1851 encouraged great increases in window area. In
jubilant recognition of this H. R. Abraham the next year made all his windows triplets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>in the first and second storeys of the W. H. Smith Building at 188-192 Strand in London,
but without using any arches at all. Two years later, however, in a building for
Heal’s furniture store in Tottenham Court Road in London, James M. Lockyer (1824-65)
carried a <i>quattrocento</i> arcade all across the first storey.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time architects and public alike had become aware of a different High Renaissance
formula from Barry’s (see Chapter <a href='#ch04'>4</a>). Beside the Reform Club in Pall Mall
Sydney Smirke’s new front of the Carlton Club, designed in 1847, was coming to
belated completion in the mid fifties. Moreover, its Sansovinesque arcades were already
echoed in the first storey of Parnell &amp; Smith’s Army and Navy Club of 1848-51 across
the way. These London models were closely followed by William B. Gingell (1819-1900)
in his West of England Bank in Corn Street, Bristol, of 1854 and quite outranked
by the great Venetian <i>palazzo</i> that David Rhind (?-1883) erected in 1855 in Prince’s
Street in Edinburgh for the Life Association of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c010'>Possibly the fine warehouse at 12 Temple Street in Bristol with three groups of triplet
arches in each of the upper storeys is by Gingell and of this date. There is none of the
Sansovinesque lushness of his bank here, but the fine workmanship of the quarry-faced
Pennant stone walls laid up in random ashlar, with smooth-cut Bath stone trim and
coloured voussoirs banding the arches, bears some resemblance to the Bristol General
Hospital he was building in 1853-7, notably in the very bold rustication of the ground-storey
arches.</p>

<p class='c010'>However that may be, two London buildings of 1855 advanced nearly as far towards
the all-arcaded front. Hodgson’s Building by Knowles in the Strand at the corner of
Chancery Lane had the general character of a <i>palazzo</i>, but all the windows were arched,
as in buildings of the <i>Rundbogenstil</i>; moreover their trim sank into the wall rather than
projecting from it, so that the wall sections between were reduced visually to mere piers,
even though they had no imposts. The Crown Life Office, in New Bridge Street,
Blackfriars, was built in 1855-7 by Ruskin’s friends Deane &amp; Woodward, with whom
he was most closely associated precisely in those years. The round-arched medieval
arcading of this façade, with the piers hardly narrower than on Knowles’s building yet
articulated by bases and imposts, may surely claim Ruskinian sanction. Here, at any rate,
was the first important contact between advanced High Victorian Gothic and the commercial
world, a contact destined to be very fruitful over the next fifteen years or so.
Henceforth even architects of no aesthetic pretension were ready to exploit arcading.</p>

<p class='c010'>The English development of arcaded masonry façades can be closely matched in
America, specifically in Philadelphia.<a id="r300"></a><a href='#f300' class='c025'><sup>[300]</sup></a> There S. D. Button (1803-97), Napoleon Le
Brun (1821-1901), and others in buildings of 1852-3 in Chestnut Street—that at 239-241
by Button is still extant—consistently used arched openings between slim piers; and
Notman in 1855 provided for the Jackson Building at 418 Arch Street a façade even
more completely articulated by arcading in all its four floors than the Crown Life
Office. By this time, moreover, the trabeated design of Bogardus’s first iron fronts had
likewise given way to ornate arcading in emulation of masonry fronts.<a id="r301"></a><a href='#f301' class='c025'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Iron remained behind the scenes in most of the English arcaded buildings. In Waterhouse’s
Fryer &amp; Binyon Warehouse in Manchester of 1856, however, whose upper walls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>had the polychrome diapering of the Doge’s Palace so much admired by Ruskin, the
first storey was opened up by an arcade carried on coupled iron columns. In the
Wellington Williams Warehouse of 1858 in Little Britain in London, the obscure City
firm of J. Young &amp; Son used arcades in all the five storeys with iron columns to support
the outer orders; thus the width of the piers could be considerably reduced, and the
effect of over-all articulation was much enhanced as in the Philadelphia buildings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Deane &amp; Woodward’s very Ruskinian project of 1857 for the new Government
Offices, with its endless Italian Gothic arcading, and a small warehouse in Merchant
Street in Bristol of 1858 by Godwin gave some impetus to the use of pointed instead of
round arches. But on the whole the best designed among the innumerable arcaded
façades in England retained the rounded form, however Gothic their other detailing
may be. In one of the largest and finest examples of the early sixties, moreover, Kassapian’s
Warehouse in Leeds Road, Bradford, perhaps by Lockwood &amp; Mawson, the detailing
is academically Roman (Plate <a href='#pl114b'>114<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Different as they are, this Bradford façade and that of Godwin’s contemporary warehouse
at 104 Stokes Croft in Bristol, so much more subtly Ruskinian than anything by
Deane &amp; Woodward, are the two masterpieces of the genre at its best
moment (Plate #113:pl113).
Of very high quality also is 60 Mark Lane in the City of London built by George
Aitchison in 1864-5. There the existence of a complete iron skeleton, presumably but
not certainly present in most of the other examples, is fully documented. Moreover, on
the rear the metal comes through to the outer face of the wall much as it did at 50
Watling Street, built some twenty years earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Philadelphia William Johnston had begun in 1849 the seven-storey Jayne Building
in Chestnut Street,<a id="r302"></a><a href='#f302' class='c025'><sup>[302]</sup></a> introducing a new vertical formula of design for commercial
façades. Above a conventional ground floor, narrow granite piers in the forms of
clustered colonnettes rise the full height of the building, merging into Venetian Gothic
tracery below a terminal parapet. Whether or not Samuel K. Hoxie, the contractor who
provided the Quincy granite for this and other Philadelphia buildings, was familiar
with the ‘granite-skeleton’ work of Parris, Rogers, and others in Boston is not clear.
But in the next few years a good many façades with a similarly vertical and ‘skeletonized’
treatment were built in Philadelphia by J. C. Hoxie and his sometime partner
Button. That across the street from the Jayne Building has already been mentioned, since
the openings between the piers are covered with segmental arches throughout. Button’s
building at 723-727 Chestnut Street of 1853 and his extant Leland Building at 37-39
South Third Street are even more ‘proto-Sullivanian’, so to put it. Louis Sullivan probably
saw and admired such things as the Jayne Building and the Leland Building when
he was working for Frank Furness in Philadelphia in the seventies; certainly they are
very premonitory of his characteristic work of the eighties and even the nineties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Various other ways of reducing the wall to little more than a masonry cladding of the
iron structural members were also in use in England as well as in America by this time.
A notable small edifice in the City of London, of uncertain date and authorship but
probably by Thomas Hague and of 1855, is at 22 Finch Lane, with another front to the
court at the side. On both these façades the two lower storeys are joined together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>visually by setting back the horizontal spandrel between them, and the moulded stonework
of the very narrow piers is of almost metallic scale and crispness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still more striking is Oriel Chambers<a id="r303"></a><a href='#f303' class='c025'><sup>[303]</sup></a> in Water Street in Liverpool, built in 1864-5
by Peter Ellis (fl. 1835-84), and another smaller building by him at 16 Cook Street of a
year or two later. On the front façades of these the masonry is scaled down quite as
much as at 22 Finch Lane but given a more decorative treatment, in both cases of rather
metallic character. At Oriel Chambers, oriels of plate glass held in delicate metal frames
are cantilevered out in every bay of all the upper storeys, producing a regular rhythm
broken only by the clumsy cresting on the top (Plate <a href='#pl114a'>114<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). At 16 Cook Street all
the stone spandrels are set back, thus emphasizing even more strongly than at Oriel
Chambers the continuous vertical lines of the mullions. The over-all pattern is once
more somewhat confused, however, by the arches across the top that link the mullions
together. The rear walls of both of Ellis’s buildings are even more open in design and
directly expressive of the metal skeleton. Towards the narrow court at the side of Oriel
Chambers only every third iron pier is clad with masonry; those between rise free
behind the glass of the horizontally sashed windows whose upper planes are slanted
inward. This is, in effect, an early example of the ‘curtain-wall’ (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>If in some technical respects the Chicago skyscraper of the nineties seems almost to
have come to premature birth in Liverpool in the sixties, as in some other respects it had
done in the Philadelphia commercial buildings of the fifties, the immediate influence of
these buildings by Ellis seems to have been almost nil. Eventually Owen Jones, in a
façade at Derby of 1872, and Thomas Ambler, in a corner building at 46-47 Boar Lane
in Leeds of 1873, did come to use only iron and glass, omitting all masonry; but more
characteristic commercial work of these years is to be seen in such warehouses by unknown
hands as the one at 1-2 York Place in Leeds, with an arcade crisply detailed in
moulded brick rising through all the upper storeys, somewhat as on the Philadelphia
buildings of the fifties, or a larger example in Strait Street in Bristol, with a much heavier
arcade subsuming several upper storeys, handsomely executed in stones of different
colours and textures and very boldly and simply detailed. Such things, however, very
soon seemed to the English not advanced but retardataire as contemporary attention
focused on the Queen Anne of Shaw’s New Zealand Chambers of 1872-3.</p>

<p class='c010'>Richardson’s very un-Shavian American Express Building<a id="r304"></a><a href='#f304' class='c025'><sup>[304]</sup></a> in Chicago of 1872-3
first brings that Mid-Western metropolis into this story. That had no arcading, but the
windows were very closely set, sometimes (it would appear) with only light metal colonnettes
as mullions between them. There was also a directness and a ‘realism’ of treatment
throughout comparable to that of Richardson’s more monumental work of this date,
notably the Hampden County Courthouse and the Buffalo State Hospital, both designed
the previous year and at this time still in construction. But Richardson’s dependence on
English commercial work of the preceding fifteen years became closer still in his first
really fine business building, the Cheney Block (now the Brown-Thompson Department
Store) built in Hartford, Conn., in 1875-6 (Plate <a href='#pl116a'>116<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Here the wide ground-storey
arcade, including a mezzanine, and the narrower arcade above, subsuming several
storeys—as on the very proto-Richardsonian warehouse in Strait Street in Bristol—are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>carried out with typically Richardsonian stoniness in quarry-faced brownstone. But the
banded arches introduce a bold note of High Victorian Gothic polychromy, and the
carved detail is in the harsh but richly naturalistic vein—also High Victorian Gothic in
spirit—of the ornament on the earliest executed portions of Trinity Church in Boston,
probably of a year or two before.</p>

<p class='c010'>Already, in New York, the skyscraper<a id="r305"></a><a href='#f305' class='c025'><sup>[305]</sup></a> had been born by this date, and leadership in
commercial architecture had crossed the Atlantic for good and all. None of the structures
dealt with so far in this chapter except the Jayne Building were more than five or
six storeys high, since it could not be expected that business clients would climb more
than four or five flights of stairs. But the average height of buildings in the financial
districts of cities had, even so, almost doubled since the eighteenth century, partly because
of the general rise in the number of storeys, partly because of much increased
storey heights. Vertical transportation of human beings, which would allow the erection
of office buildings considerably more than five storeys high—industrial buildings were
often much taller already—became increasingly feasible during the forties and fifties.
Hoists for goods were a commonplace of English warehouse design after 1840, and in
1844 the Bunker Hill Monument had a passenger-hoist operated by a steam engine. In
New York the Haughwout Store on Broadway had in 1857 the first practical passenger
lift or elevator to be installed in an ordinary urban structure. This was of the type developed
by Elisha G. Otis. A lift of another sort was introduced in the Fifth Avenue
Hotel in New York later that year. Those of 1860 in the Westminster Palace Hotel in
London apparently did not function, at least for some years. The Equitable Building, for
which Arthur Gilman and Edward Kimball, with George B. Post (1837-1913) as the
associated engineer, won the competition in 1868, was the first office building in New
York to have a lift from the time of its completion in 1871. Immediately after this lifts
were introduced in several other comparable structures, and one- or two-storey mansards
were often added to the tops of existing buildings. A great change was thus at hand
in New York in the early seventies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the Panic of 1873, the mid seventies saw the construction of what may properly
be considered the first skyscrapers, the nine-storey (260-foot) Tribune Building
and the ten-storey (230-foot) Western Union Building. Both were therefore about
double the height even of the tallest office structures, such as the five-storey (130-foot)
Equitable Building erected during the preceding boom period. These first skyscrapers
rose to altitudes reached hitherto in America only by church spires, as general views of
the New York skyline around 1875 make evident. Neither Hunt’s New York Tribune
Building, extant but since carried many storeys higher, nor Post’s Western Union
Telegraph Building, long since demolished, incorporated any other technical innovations;<a id="r306"></a><a href='#f306' class='c025'><sup>[306]</sup></a>
nor was their design at all closely related, like that of Richardson’s Cheney
Block in Hartford, to the advanced English commercial work of the previous decade.
Paradoxically, the French-trained Hunt’s building is somewhat the more English of the
two in character; but, for all the direct expressiveness of the window grouping in triplets
in each bay, the detail throughout is coarse and gawky, and the silhouette of the very
tall mansard and the asymmetrically placed tower was from the first overbearing. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>later addition of many more storeys has made the building even more top-heavy in appearance.
The Tribune Building was of interest chiefly for its relatively great height,
now unnoticeable among the much taller skyscrapers built around it later. Its almost
complete avoidance of any sort of archaeological styling, however, such as the
Romanesquoid of Richardson’s Cheney Block or the violently polychromatic and
spiky Gothic of Hunt’s own Divinity School at Yale, on which construction was still at
this date proceeding, is certainly worth remark also.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Western Union Building of Post was only nominally French, for its rather
heavy-handed Second Empire treatment owed more to earlier English and American
designs in this mode than to anything Parisian (Plate <a href='#pl115a'>115<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But the exterior was more
orderly, if less expressive, than that of Hunt’s skyscraper and the mansards on top piled
up as grandly to the centrally placed tower as on the big contemporary Post Office
near by. Yet stylistically both Post’s and Hunt’s buildings were out of date almost as
soon as they were finished; and after the hiatus caused by the depression of the seventies
the locus of the skyscraper story moved westward to Chicago.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chicago, already the metropolis of the Middle West, had almost no architectural
traditions at this time. First developed as a city in the thirties, the need for rapid building
in timber had led to the invention or development of what is called ‘balloon-frame’
construction, in which relatively light studs or scantlings, rising wall high,
form a cage or crate whose members are fastened together by a liberal use of machine-made
nails. Balloon-frame construction, thus, is a typical offshoot of the industrial revolution,
becoming feasible only with the mechanization of the saw-mill and of the manufacture
of nails. Theoretically, there might be thought to be some analogy between this
New World method of carpentry, so different from the heavy framing of the Old
World, hitherto always used in America as well, and metal construction. There is no
evidence, however, that Chicago took to iron with any greater enthusiasm in the fifties
and sixties than did New York or various other cities; indeed, St Louis seems to have
had more and finer examples of cast-iron fronts, particularly in the early seventies. As
late as that, moreover, the new cities of the American Northwest were obtaining cast-iron
fronts prefabricated from Britain, just as San Francisco had obtained many of her
warehouses and immigrant dwellings in 1849-50.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the opening of the seventies a terrific conflagration<a id="r307"></a><a href='#f307' class='c025'><sup>[307]</sup></a> all but wiped out Chicago.
The need for rapid rebuilding drew thither ambitious architects and engineers from all
over the East, but the immediate results of their activities were anything but edifying.
Architectural leadership was still centred in Boston and New York; in any case, that
leadership had rarely been more confused than in the early seventies when even Richardson
was only just maturing his personal style. Richardson’s own Chicago building for
the American Express Company was doubtless too indeterminate in character to attract
a local following; nor did he build again in Chicago until the mid eighties, by which
time various versions of the Richardsonian were already reaching Chicago at second or
third hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the Chicago architectural scene had any virtues around 1880 they were largely
negative ones: no established traditions, no real professional leaders, and ignorance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>all architectural styles past or present. Among the architects who had settled in Chicago
in the seventies was a Dane, Dankmar Adler (1844-1900). Into his office in 1879, first as
chief draughtsman but soon as partner, came the young Bostonian Louis Sullivan. As has
been noted before, Sullivan had been trained first in Ware’s school at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and later, until he revolted against its rigid doctrines, at the
École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Having worked for Frank Furness, wildest of American
High Victorians, Sullivan picked Chicago not alone for its evident professional opportunities
but also because he liked the idea of working where there were no hampering
traditions. (Moreover, his parents had moved there from Boston.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The earliest building of any real originality designed by Sullivan, the Rothschild
Store in Chicago of 1880-1, seems at first a turgid compilation of barbarisms. Examined
more closely, however, and compared with the Leiter Building on its right, which was
built two years earlier by the engineer-architect William Le Baron Jenney (1832-1907),
the two sorts of innovation that Sullivan essayed here can be readily recognized. On the
one hand there is the ornament,<a id="r308"></a><a href='#f308' class='c025'><sup>[308]</sup></a> undefinable in historic terms yet with a kind of
similarity—almost certainly accidental—to the Anglo-Japanese detail of Nesfield and
Godwin. At this stage in Sullivan’s career the originality of his ornament must be remarked
but can hardly be admired. Below his elaborate ornamental cresting, on the
other hand, Sullivan handled the main architectonic elements of his façade with considerable
novelty and most admirable logic. Although the building is not tall—no skyscraper,
that is, even by the modest standards of 1880—Sullivan did not hesitate to follow
the lead of the Philadelphia commercial architects of the fifties in emphasizing the
vertical. This he accomplished by continuing the mullions that subdivide his bays across
the spandrels, somewhat as Ellis had done fifteen years before in his buildings in Liverpool,
rather than by using a multiplicity of masonry piers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sullivan’s next Chicago building, the Revell Store erected for Martin Ryerson in
1881-3, continued the theme of the Rothschild Store, but extended it over a much
larger corner block with considerable chastening of the ornamental treatment at the
top. The Troescher Building of 1884, which came next in sequence, is very much finer.
Widely-spaced piers of plain brickwork rise the full height of the façade above a
slightly Richardsonian ground-storey arcade of rock-faced stone; between them there
are no oriels, as on Ellis’s Oriel Chambers or his Ryerson Building<a id="r309"></a><a href='#f309' class='c025'><sup>[309]</sup></a> of the previous
year, but broad horizontal windows separated by recessed spandrels. These spandrels are
rather like Ellis’s on his other building at 16 Cook Street, but their actual prototypes
are to be found, more probably, in Philadelphia buildings by Button such as the one at
723-727 Chestnut Street. The ornament here, now still further chastened, is largely
confined to these spandrels. The curved cresting across the top, however, recalls a little
the turgid crown of the Rothschild façade.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sullivan’s early buildings were not very tall, and they did not advance the technical
development of the skyscraper. In these same years, however, other Chicago architects
were doing so to notable effect. For the ten-storey Montauk Block of 1882-3, tall, but
no taller than the first New York skyscrapers of ten years before, Burnham &amp; Root
introduced spread foundations to carry its great weight on the muddy Chicago soil,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>out of which earlier buildings had, literally, to be hoisted every few years. In design they
were content, however, with a range of ten almost identical storeys of plain brick pierced
by regularly spaced segmental-arched windows. Obvious as this treatment may seem,
it took courage to use it at a time when most architects were still trying to disguise the
embarrassing height of buildings only half as tall by grouping their storeys together in
twos and threes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Home Life Insurance Building begun in 1883 was also only ten storeys tall.<a id="r310"></a><a href='#f310' class='c025'><sup>[310]</sup></a> But
in building it Jenney invented, or at least introduced in Chicago, what is specifically
called ‘skyscraper construction’, that is a method of carrying the external masonry
cladding on metal shelves bolted to the internal skeleton. Jenney, however, probably
thought he was merely tying together his metal skeleton and his brickwork, not
carrying the latter entirely, though this was found to be the case when the structure
of the building was carefully examined during its demolition. The Home Insurance
Building, in any case, looked far more as if its external walls were bearing than
do any of Sullivan’s early works. Jenney, moreover, fought shy of the frankness of
Burnham &amp; Root’s treatment of the Montauk Block; instead he phrased his storeys in
groups, almost as if several buildings of normal three- or four-storey height had been
casually piled one on top of the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the Home Insurance was finished in 1885 two more major commercial monuments
were rising in Chicago, Richardson’s Marshall Field Wholesale Store (Plate <a href='#pl116b'>116<span class='fss'>B</span></a>),
last but one of the large buildings erected in Chicago with walls entirely of bearing
masonry, and Burnham &amp; Root’s Rookery Building (see Chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>). Both were begun
in 1885, Richardson’s being finished in 1887 and Burnham &amp; Root’s a year earlier in
1886. The exterior of the eleven-storey Rookery Building is not an example of the
stripped ‘functionalism’ that these architects had introduced in their Montauk Block
but rather a provincial imitation of the Richardsonian. In the court walls, however, the
architects used—and with complete awareness of its implications—the new structural
method of Jenney’s Home Insurance Building, carrying the brickwork above the sides
of the central glass-roofed lobby entirely on the internal metal<a id="r311"></a><a href='#f311' class='c025'><sup>[311]</sup></a> skeleton.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the advent of Richardson in 1885, the main lines of development in commercial
architecture, both as regards design and as regards construction, might seem to have
been concentrated in Chicago. It is well therefore to note again that McKim, Mead &amp;
White in their Goelet Building on Broadway in New York of 1885-6 provided almost as
frank an expression of the skyscraper, or tall office building of many identical storeys, at
least above their Renaissance ground-floor arcade, as did Burnham &amp; Root in the Montauk
Block. Their windows, however, were phrased in triplets like Hunt’s on the Tribune
Building and also grouped vertically within tall bay-width panels of moulded
brick rising with only one break to the cornice. This was a quite frank solution of the
problem, and is hardly to be castigated as ‘traditional’ or even as ‘un-functional’.
Moreover, another New York building, Babb, Cook &amp; Willard’s De Vinne Press of
1885 in Lafayette Street, is not altogether unworthy of comparison with the Field store.
It lacks the regularity and the grandeur of scale of Richardson’s masterpiece, but
George F. Babb used his fine red brick in a belated <i>Rundbogenstil</i> way, and not without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>some conscious reminiscence, one may presume, of Durand’s exemplars of the beginning
of the century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Richardson’s last commercial work, the Ames Building in Harrison Avenue in Boston
of 1886-7, on which the arcade was carried the full height of the building and the reveals
much reduced, had no immediate influence in Chicago (see Chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>). Sullivan’s first
really great work, the Auditorium Building (now Roosevelt College) in Chicago, derived
for the most part straight from the Field store, at least as regards the exterior.
Designed in 1886 and built in 1887-9, this is a vast and complex edifice, or group of
edifices, with a hotel on the Michigan Avenue front, an opera-house entered in the
middle of the Congress Street side, and offices along Wabash Avenue at the rear. The
walls are all of bearing masonry still. In order to incorporate more storeys than Richardson
had ever done, Sullivan carried up his heavy rock-faced granite base through two
mezzanine levels and increased the number of floors subsumed by the main arcade
which rises from the first storey (Plate <a href='#pl117a'>117<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). He also used light stone throughout,
instead of the red granite and the brownstone of the Field store, with its surfaces all
smooth-cut above the mezzanines.</p>

<p class='c010'>This flattening of the wall-plane was carried even further on the tower which rises
above the portal of the opera-house in Congress Street. On that wide arched panels of
very slight projection are filled with articulated screens of stone in which the windows
are arranged in a continuous grid with no evident storey lines. The eaves gallery at the
top of the tower, a stubby colonnade set in a long horizontal panel with a continuous
ribbon-window behind—the window in fact of the Adler &amp; Sullivan office—is so like
Thomson’s on the front of his Queen’s Park church of the sixties in Glasgow that it is
hard to believe Sullivan did not know it. Yet other evidence indicates that he continued
to abjure all European influence at this point in his career.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the interiors, particularly the bar and the banquet hall at the top of the hotel, Sullivan’s
ornament changed even more markedly than his exterior design. Here also there is
possibly Richardsonian influence, but coming from the Byzantinizing detail worked
out by John Galen Howard of the Richardson office for the MacVeagh house of 1885-7
in Chicago rather than from the Field store.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, one cannot entirely discount the possibility of a contribution in the field
of ornament by a brilliant young man of twenty, Frank Lloyd Wright, whom Sullivan
and Adler had just taken on as a draughtsman in 1887 and who was soon given
charge of the innumerable detail drawings that this vast project required. Nurtured on
Owen Jones’s <i>Grammar of Ornament</i>,<a id="r312"></a><a href='#f312' class='c025'><sup>[312]</sup></a> which the Paris-trained Sullivan claimed not to
have known, as well as on the writings of Ruskin, Morris, and Viollet-le-Duc, Wright
may perhaps have encouraged Sullivan to move away from the bold coarseness of his
earlier ornament towards the lush elaboration of intricately plastic surface decoration
henceforth characteristic of his work. It is tempting, even, to believe that Jones’s page of
Celtic ornament particularly attracted the Irish Sullivan’s fancy.<a id="r313"></a><a href='#f313' class='c025'><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Together with the Auditorium, though commissioned a year later, there was also
rising in Chicago in 1887-9 the Tacoma Building of William Holabird (1854-1923) and
Martin Roche (1855-1927), two young architects trained in Jenney’s office. Here the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>exterior walls on the two fronts were entirely carried by the metal skeleton within, only
the rear walls and some of the interior partitions being of bearing masonry like the walls
of the Auditorium. Moreover, this fact was made evident in the frank if not particularly
distinguished treatment of the two fronts. Vertical ranges of oriels were carried the full
height of the building, and there was only a minimal brick and terracotta sheathing of
the structural verticals and horizontals. A more or less Richardsonian cornice capped the
whole, but the general effect was closer to Ellis’s Oriel Chambers of the sixties in Liverpool
or to some of Sullivan’s earlier buildings than to the Field store.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the general swing of Eastern architects towards the Neo-Academic in
these years, some who were doing commercial work were not out of step with what
was happening in Chicago. For example, there are office buildings and warehouses in
Boston and New York of relatively modest height built in the late eighties and early
nineties that emulate in brick the arcading of the Field store with almost as much success
as Sullivan. Similar things can be seen in many Middle and Far Western cities, but these
derive more probably from Sullivan or Burnham &amp; Root than directly from Richardson.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Middle West, moreover, McKim, Mead &amp; White were building in 1888-90
two very large business buildings, still with bearing masonry walls, for the New York
Life Insurance Company, one in Omaha, Nebraska, and one in Kansas City, Missouri,
of effectively identical design. Unlike the already characteristic Chicago ‘slabs’—the
quadrangular plan of the Rookery Building is exceptional—these are
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped,
and each has a tower rising above
the main mass at the rear of the court. The treatment of the walls
with tall arcading follows as evidently from the Field store as does
Sullivan’s at the Auditorium; like that of the contemporary Boston
Public Library, however, the fairly simple detailing is of High
Renaissance rather than Richardsonian Romanesque character.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before these towering blocks were finished in the West the new ‘skyscraper construction’
had been introduced in New York by Bradford Lee Gilbert (1853-1911). His
Tower Building of 1888-9, as its name implies, was a tower, not a slab, with more or
less Richardsonian detailing. It is worth noting that the Tower Building—ten storeys,
119 feet—was <i>not</i> as tall as the first New York skyscrapers built in the early seventies
with bearing walls. Indeed, Post’s World or Pulitzer Building of 1889-90 in New York
with twenty-six storeys, the tallest built up to then—309 feet—still had bearing walls.
Of course, the Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, exceeded in height by a great deal all
the skyscrapers of its day whatever their construction; indeed, it was not overtopped
until the Empire State Building in New York rose from the designs of Shreve, Lamb &amp;
Harmon in the early 1930s at the end of the second wave of skyscraper building following
the First World War.</p>

<p class='c010'>Post’s Western Union Building of the early seventies was in the Second Empire
mode; his World Building was still French, but what can better be called ‘Beaux-Arts’.
It is designed like a series of three- or four-storey Renaissance palaces, one on top of the
other, and crowned with a large and ornate dome. The next New York skyscrapers all
followed the new structural method introduced by Gilbert in the Tower Building; but
Post, Price, and the other architects who designed them used an ornate paraphernalia of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Renaissance ornamentation with none of the discretion of McKim, Mead &amp; White on
their Kansas City and Omaha insurance buildings. Characteristic of the period are
Price’s American Surety Building at Broadway and Wall Street, begun in 1894, and his
St James Building of 1897-8 at 1133 Broadway, both in New York, and Post’s Park
Building in Pittsburgh, completed in 1896. The latter’s Havemeyer Building in New
York, completed earlier, in 1892, was still somewhat Richardsonian however.</p>

<p class='c010'>The maturing of an original sort of skyscraper design around 1890 is a Middle
Western, and almost specifically a Chicago, story to which New York architects made
no contribution. Boston’s architectural leadership had ended with the death of Richardson;
despite the prominence of McKim, Mead &amp; White and their large Eastern following,
leadership in this field passed almost at once to Chicago. It was most appropriate
that Richardson’s masterpiece, the Field store, should have been built there; the inspiration
it provided, as we have already seen in the case of the Auditorium Building, played
an important part in the succeeding Middle Western development.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1889-90 Jenney built for Levi Z. Leiter a large building on South Clark Street in
Chicago now occupied by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company. In this he not only used the new
‘skyscraper construction’ for the exterior walls but also—with the presumptive aid of his
assistant and later partner William Bryce Mundie (1863-1939)—arrived at an expression
of its structural character almost as logical as that of the Tacoma Building yet much
more monumental. Like most other Chicago designers in these years, Jenney and Mundie
were influenced here by the Field store. The uncompromisingly block-like shape of
this tremendous building, with its heavy plain entablature and pilaster-like corner piers,
is Richardsonian both in its scale and in its simplicity (Plate <a href='#pl117b'>117<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The various groupings
of stone mullions that clad the main piers and subdivide the bays, lithe and light
though they are, were clearly envisaged as Romanesque colonnettes and even carry
modest foliate capitals. Despite the dichotomy of the solidly Richardsonian silhouette
and the open screen-like treatment of the walls, the effect is coherent and dignified. In
this respect the Sears, Roebuck Building is superior to Sullivan’s very Richardsonian<a id="r314"></a><a href='#f314' class='c025'><sup>[314]</sup></a>
Opera House Building in Pueblo, Colorado, of 1890 which was burned in the 1920s.
The Walker Warehouse in Chicago of 1888-9 better displayed his great talent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three buildings of the early nineties, two in Chicago by Daniel H. Burnham’s firm and
one in St Louis by Sullivan, illustrate the wide range of creative possibilities in skyscraper
design at this point. The most advanced is surely the Reliance Building, at least
in terms of direct structural expression. This was carried up only four storeys in 1890,
though extended to its present thirteen storeys by D. H. Burnham &amp; Company in 1894.
As completed, this is a refined and perfected version of Holabird &amp; Roche’s Tacoma
Building (Plate <a href='#pl115b'>115<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The light-coloured terracotta cladding of the vertical members,
particularly on the flat oriels, is reduced to a minimum; the terminal member is a thin
slab, not a cornice or an entablature; and the only stylistic reminiscence is in the cusped
panelling—neither Romanesque nor Renaissance, but slightly Late Gothic in character—of
the spandrels. What we see was presumably designed as well as built in 1894.<a id="r315"></a><a href='#f315' class='c025'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Burnham &amp; Root’s other significant skyscraper of this particular moment, the sixteen-storey
Monadnock Building begun in 1891, the last tall Chicago building with bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>walls of brick, was and still remains more famous than the Reliance; doubtless it is also
finer, although much mid-twentieth-century critical opinion has favoured the Sears,
Roebuck Building of Jenney &amp; Mundie and the Reliance because they are more advanced
technically. The smooth shank of the Monadnock, varied only by the slight projection
of the recurrent oriels, has a most subtle and elegant taper or reverse entasis. The
final bending outward of the brickwork to provide a cove cornice unifies the whole
formal concept with extraordinary effectiveness. Few large buildings have ever achieved
such monumental force with such simple means. There is almost literally no detail of
any sort, whether derivative or original.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sullivan’s Wainwright Building of 1890-1 in St Louis, Missouri, in which he and
Adler used ‘skyscraper construction’ for the first time, no longer dominates two- and
three-storey neighbours as it did when newly built; thus the prominence that the
relatively great height gave it in the city picture of the nineties can hardly be
realized today. But Sullivan undoubtedly sought to emphasize what seemed to contemporaries,
as they do not to posterity, its very tall proportions (Plate <a href='#pl118'>118</a>). Continuous
pilaster-like piers of brick, quite like those on his Troescher Building of 1884, clad the
vertical elements of the steel skeleton, yet identical brick piers with no major structural
members behind them also serve as intervening mullions. But at the base the wide
windows of the ground storey and the mezzanine reveal the true width of the actual
bays of the steel skeleton as the treatment of the shank of the building does not. The piers
are considerably broader than most of those on the Sears, Roebuck Building; but they
are also topped, like Mundie’s, with ornament that forms a sort of capital. Moreover,
the attic storey above is quite hidden behind a deep band of the richest Sullivanian ornament
elsewhere restricted, as on the Troescher Building, to the recessed spandrels. The
‘cornice’ above this frieze-like attic is merely a slab, but a much thicker one than that
which caps the Reliance Building. Nothing of Richardson’s direct influence is left; but
by now Sullivan had learned from the Field store the basic lessons of scale and order,
applying them here in a visually sure but not particularly frank way to the new type of
metal-skeleton construction. The plan is
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped,
like those of the McKim, Mead &amp; White buildings in Kansas City and
Omaha, but the court is to the rear, so that the block appears unified
from the surrounding streets.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Sullivan’s next important work, the Schiller Building in Chicago of 1891-2, he
adopted—exceptionally for him—a truly tower-like shape. Here the masonry piers that
clad the structural steel stanchions are not doubled by identical mullions between; instead
these piers are linked by arches below a sort of frieze. The ‘frieze’ is really a very
ornately arcaded eaves-gallery, not a flat band as on the Wainwright Building, occupying
a whole storey below the thick slab cornice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Interchange of ideas was continuous in these years between the various Chicago architects’
offices, while the influence of the Academic Revival in the East, dominant in almost
all the buildings at the World’s Fair of 1893 save Sullivan’s own Transportation Building,
was still negligible in the commercial field. Thus Sullivan’s Stock Exchange Building of
1893-4 in Chicago borrowed its rather clumsy ground storey and mezzanine, with a
cavernously Richardsonian arched entrance, from Burnham’s Ashland Block of 1892 and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>its oriels from the Tacoma or possibly the Reliance Building. These oriels alternate with
horizontal openings of the type known as ‘Chicago windows’ sharply cut through the
smooth light-coloured terracotta of the wall plane. ‘Chicago windows’, with a wide
fixed pane in the centre and narrower sashes that open on either side, were used by most
Chicago architects in this decade and the next. A heavy moulded cornice, not just a
thick slab, crowns the whole above a colonnaded eaves-gallery somewhat like the one at
the top of the Auditorium tower.</p>

<p class='c010'>What should probably be considered Sullivan’s masterpiece, the Guaranty Building
in Buffalo, N.Y., followed in 1894-5 (Plate <a href='#pl119'>119</a>). One of the most significant new
themes in the design of this skyscraper, whose premonitory character can only be fully
appreciated in relation to the use of <i>pilotis</i> in later modern architecture (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>), is
already to be found in a project of Sullivan’s of the previous year for the St Louis Trust &amp;
Savings Bank. This is the treatment of the ground storey, where the terracotta sheathed
piers were isolated from the wall plane by bending back the tops of the shop-windows.
The piers are thus nearly free-standing and seem to lift the shaft of the building above
them right off the ground. This allows circumambient space to penetrate under the
main volume of the building. Thus the fact that the edifice is a hollow cage is very
strongly suggested, and the wide shop-windows do not appear to undermine the walls
above them as in so much commercial work of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are several reasons, not intrinsic to Sullivan’s design, that explain why the
Guaranty remains the most effective of all the early skyscrapers. Since downtown
Buffalo has not filled up with buildings of equal or greater height in the way of downtown
St Louis and the Chicago Loop, the Guaranty still rises high above most of its
modest neighbours, in effect a tower as well as a slab, although actually of
<span class="sans">U</span>-shaped
plan like the Wainwright. In this
city, moreover, which has in the last sixty years remained
considerably cleaner than Chicago, the colour of the tawny terracotta
sheathing has not been so much obscured by grime as on the Stock
Exchange Building. These were happy local conditions that Sullivan
could not foresee.</p>

<p class='c010'>The plastic handling of the crown of the Guaranty was perhaps suggested to Sullivan
by the effectiveness of the cove at the top of Burnham &amp; Root’s Monadnock Building.
Here the crowns of the arched façade bays—two to each structural bay, as the wide
spacing of the piers at ground-storey level so clearly reveals—are related to the outward
curve of the top of the wall below the terminal slab. The profuse and melodious curvilinear
ornament, subsuming the round attic windows, echoes and complements the
plastic theme. This is an example, rare even in Sullivan’s most mature work of the mid
and late nineties, of the successful integration of architectonic and decorative effects. The
treatment of the terracotta cladding throughout the exterior of the Guaranty, moreover,
covered all over as it is with lacy geometrical ornament in very low relief, seems to lighten
the whole. The cladding is read as a mere protective shell carried by the underlying
steel structural members and not as solid brickwork like the piers of the Wainwright
Building.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as the Wainwright Building may be contrasted on the one hand with the still
greater solidity of the Monadnock Building—in that case justified by the bearing-wall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>construction—and on the other with the openness of the Reliance, so it is of interest to
compare the Guaranty with two other big business buildings of 1895 by other Chicago
architects. In the Ellicott Square Building, also in Buffalo, Burnham was strongly influenced
by his close association with McKim at the World’s Fair. With the assistance of
his designer Atwood, whose short life ended this same year, he adopted the elaborate
Renaissance membering and the heavy masonry vocabulary of the New York skyscraper
architects, although he retained the quadrangular plan and the glass-roofed central court
of the Rookery. On the other hand, in Chicago Solon S. Beman (1853-1914) in the
Studebaker (now Brunswick) Building came very close to providing an all-glass front,
despite the profusion of Late Gothic frippery with which he detailed his very restricted
terracotta cladding.</p>

<p class='c010'>Adler had parted from Sullivan in 1895, but Sullivan’s career as a skyscraper builder
continued for a few more years at a very high level. In his next skyscraper, the Condict
Building in New York of 1897-9, he reduced very considerably the width of the
mullions between the piers so that they became mere colonnettes, and even these are
omitted in the first storey. But this highly logical differentiation between pier and mullion,
related to the treatment of his Rothschild Store of 1880-1, still gets lost at the
top in a flurry of ornamentation almost as turgid in its very different and almost <i>quattrocento</i><a id="r316"></a><a href='#f316' class='c025'><sup>[316]</sup></a>
way as the top of that very early façade. The treatment of the ground storey was
originally like that of the Guaranty, but has been modified by later shop-fronts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next year Holabird &amp; Roche built three contiguous buildings on Michigan
Avenue in Chicago for Harold McCormick (Plate <a href='#pl120'>120</a>). The two southerly ones are
excellent examples of the work of the Chicago School; they are a little less extensively
glazed than Beman’s Studebaker Building or Holabird &amp; Roche’s own McClurg
Building of 1899 but with crisp and simple, if quite conventional, moulded brick detail
on the piers and rather plain cornices of wholly academic character. Standard Chicago
windows are used throughout. The third façade on the north, that of the Gage Building
at 18 South Michigan Avenue, while fronting a structure also by Holabird &amp; Roche, is
itself by Sullivan. A different arrangement of the windows, a bolder moulding of the
terracotta cladding of the piers—there were no intervening mullions now, any more
than on his Troescher Building of 1884—and a strategic spotting of the chicory-like
ornament—as well as, originally, a rich picture-frame-like band around the ground-storey
shop-window—produce an entirely different effect. This effect is no less expressive
of the underlying structure, but it represents a fuller and subtler deployment of architectural
resources than Holabird &amp; Roche provided on the façades next door.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Gage Building was Sullivan’s penultimate major work. With the Carson, Pirie &amp;
Scott Department Store his career as an architect of big commercial buildings came to
an end. This was designed in 1899 and the original three-bay and nine-storey section on
Madison Street built in 1899-1901 for Schlesinger &amp; Mayer; it was completed in 1903-4
for the present owners with the erection of the twelve-storey section that runs along
State Street.<a id="r317"></a><a href='#f317' class='c025'><sup>[317]</sup></a> This building, which was Sullivan’s swan song, has also seemed to many
critics his masterpiece (Plate <a href='#pl121'>121</a>). It lacks, however, the unity of the earlier Guaranty
Building, having been built in two—indeed actually in three—successive campaigns.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Despite the prominence of its site in the Chicago Loop, the store is inevitably overshadowed
today by later and taller neighbours; nevertheless, it occupies a very high
place in the Sullivanian canon.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is no vertical emphasis except on the rounded pavilion at the corner, where
continuous colonnettes rise the full height between the rather narrow bays; this feature
was intended from the first but not built until 1903-4. The wide Chicago windows
are crisply cut through the white terracotta sheathing just like the windows between the
oriels on the Stock Exchange Building. The underlying grid of the structural steel
frame—always more horizontal than vertical in effect, as the Reliance Building so clearly
reveals—completely controls the surface pattern of the fenestration. On the Guaranty
Building Sullivan emphasized the structural piers at their base by bending back the shop-windows
of the ground storey; here it was the topmost storey that he set back, revealing
the tops of the piers like little free-standing columns beneath the terminal slab in the
spirit of his earlier eaves galleries. This treatment—most unfortunately replaced in 1948
by a flush parapet—increased very notably the effect of volume in much the same
way as the parallel treatment at the base of the Guaranty.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the base here, however, the shop-windows are carried up two storeys and given
picture-frame-like surrounds, somewhat as on the Gage Building. In the cast-iron ornamentation
of these frames, now much simplified, as also in that of the canopy on the
north side and around the entrances in the rounded corner pavilion, Sullivan reached a
peak of virtuosity in the lush decoration that has seemed to later critics quite at odds
with the severe rectangularity of the façades above. There can be no question, however,
that Sullivan considered ornament of the greatest importance in architecture and gave to
its invention and elaboration his best thought and energy. It is certainly an interesting
coincidence, moreover, rather than a matter of influence either way, that in these very
years in Europe the newest architectural mode, the Art Nouveau, also put heavy emphasis
on a somewhat similar sort of curvilinear decoration, often in association with exposed
metal construction, and most notably on department stores
(see Chapters <a href='#ch16'>16</a>, <a href='#ch17'>17</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Sullivan’s ornament never had much influence either at home or abroad. Although
Sullivanian skyscrapers of varying size and quality exist in many Middle Western and
Far Western cities, most of them built in the first two decades of the new century, only
the Rockefeller Building in Cleveland, built in 1903-6 by Knox &amp; Elliot and extended
laterally in 1910, really employs ornament, although of a drier and more geometrical
order deriving from Owen Jones’s <i>Grammar</i>, in anything like Sullivan’s way. On
Sullivan’s own late buildings, mostly tiny banks in small Middle Western towns, and in
comparable work by his former assistant George G. Elmslie (1871-1952)<a id="r318"></a><a href='#f318' class='c025'><sup>[318]</sup></a> and William
G. Purcell (b. 1880) the ornament tends to get more out of hand than on any of his skyscrapers
of the nineties except perhaps the Condict Building. The best of Sullivan’s is
the National Farmers’ Bank at Owatonna, Minn., of 1908; but Purcell &amp; Elmslie’s
Merchants’ National Bank in Winona, Minn., completed in 1911, might easily be mistaken
for Sullivan’s work, for it is of comparable quality.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the skyscrapers of the late nineties and the first two decades of the twentieth century
designed in other Chicago architectural offices, such as D. H. Burnham &amp; Co.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Jenney &amp; Mundie, and Holabird &amp; Roche, there was rarely any attempt to vie with
Sullivan as an ornamentalist but rather a continuance of the straightforward sort of design
of the last-named firm’s Michigan Avenue buildings of 1898-9. A particularly fine
and very large example is their Cable Building in Chicago of 1899. In the Fisher Building
of 1897, also in Chicago, the Burnham firm more or less repeated the formula
of the Reliance Building, but with a profusion of rather archaeological Late Gothic
detail, eschewing the New York influence apparent in the Ellicott Square Building of
1895. Jenney &amp; Mundie, rather more than the others, tended to follow the leadership of
the New York architects of the day in using academic detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole, the Chicago School continued to be vigorous, if not especially creative,
down to the First World War, all the way through a period during which New
York skyscrapers, still usually conceived as shaped towers rather than as plain slabs, received
a succession of different stylistic disguises as they rose higher and higher. The
forty-seven-storey (612-foot) Singer Building<a id="r319"></a><a href='#f319' class='c025'><sup>[319]</sup></a> of 1907 by Ernest Flagg (1857-1947)
with its curious bulbous mansard—’Beaux-Arts’ of a quite aberrant sort—was followed
by the campanile-like 700-foot Metropolitan Tower in Madison Square of 1909
by Napoleon LeBrun &amp; Sons;<a id="r320"></a><a href='#f320' class='c025'><sup>[320]</sup></a> and that in turn by the cathedral-like Late Gothic
elaboration of the Woolworth Building<a id="r321"></a><a href='#f321' class='c025'><sup>[321]</sup></a> of 1913 by Cass Gilbert (1859-1934), fifty-two
storeys and 792 feet tall, which is still one of the major landmarks of downtown
New York (Plate <a href='#pl178'>178</a>). A new flurry of skyscraper building followed in the twenties
(see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>). The story with which this chapter is concerned, however, had reached
its climax with the Chicago skyscrapers of the nineties, even though they were soon
overshadowed in height and in contemporary esteem by the taller and more spectacular
towers of Manhattan. Moreover, most of the big cities of the country, including
Chicago, eventually sought to imitate the New York mode. But size is not, even in this
period, a measure of quality, and the tallest skyscrapers are not the best, any more than
the longest bridges are the most beautiful. So far the results of the revival of skyscraper
building in the last fifteen years have rather confirmed this judgement (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>A difficult question remains to be asked, even if it cannot be very satisfactorily
answered: Why was the nineteenth-century development of commercial architecture,
from Nash’s Regent Street to Sullivan’s skyscrapers, so completely an Anglo-American
achievement? A few reasons may at least be suggested. On the Continent
business activity was less concentrated in special urban districts in the nineteenth century,
and was hence less likely to develop its own architectural programme. The big new
nineteenth-century blocks in cities like Paris and Vienna and Rome generally serve a
variety of purposes and almost always consist of residential flats in the upper storeys. In
England and in America, on the other hand, most dwellings were still not flats but
houses before 1900, and these fled farther and farther from the commercial areas as the
nineteenth century progressed. The high property values in the central urban districts
of the big Anglo-American cities, rising very rapidly in the second half of the century,
encouraged the exploitation of their sites with taller and taller buildings. These values
also helped to drive out the earlier inhabitants, leaving such areas as the London City
and the Chicago Loop all but deserted after office hours.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Neither the office blocks of London and the big provincial English cities of the fifties
and sixties nor, <i>a fortiori</i>, the skyscrapers of New York of the seventies and those of
Chicago of the nineties can readily be matched elsewhere—except, of course, to some
extent in the British Dominions and Colonies. Yet European cities do offer certain
nineteenth-century commercial structures that are of real interest. The covered <i>passages</i>
and <i>galeries</i>, from the modest ones of the early decades of the century in Paris to Mengoni’s
great Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan (Plate <a href='#pl075b'>75<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) of the sixties, offered
an urbanistic device of real significance. This is barely to be appreciated in the various
extant English and American examples, such as the still flourishing Burlington Arcade in
London or the Arcade in Providence, R.I., which is maintained as a historic monument
though all but deserted by commerce.</p>

<p class='c010'>Related to these structures serving multiple business purposes was the gradual development
of the department store, a grouping together of various separate shops under
one management and one roof, of which the Galeries du Commerce et de l’Industrie in
Paris of 1838 were a relatively early example (Plate <a href='#pl062a'>62<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Exploiting like the <i>galeries</i> the
possibilities of iron-and-glass roofing, the early Continental examples of the department
store had their more modest English and American counterparts such as Owen Jones’s
Crystal Palace Bazar of 1858 in London or the Z.C.M.I. in Salt Lake City, founded by
the Mormon leader Brigham Young himself and housed in cast iron in 1868.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most notable later nineteenth-century department stores were in Paris and Berlin.
In Paris the still extant Bon Marché of 1876 in the Rue de Sèvres by L. C. Boileau
(1837-?), son of the builder of several Second Empire churches of iron, and the engineer
Eiffel and the Printemps at the corner of the Rue de Rome and the Boulevard Haussmann
of 1881-9 by Paul Sédille (1836-1900) were remarkable in conception if without
much distinction of design. However, the Bon Marché is now completely masked
externally by a masonry façade of the 1920s, and little of interest remains visible inside
the Printemps. Of the portion of the Wertheim Department Store in Berlin built by
Alfred Messel (1853-1909) in 1896-9 nothing survives.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just after 1900, when the metal-and-glass construction of the interiors of department
stores came to be generally exposed externally, this line of development came to its
climax (<a href='#pl131b'>Plates 131<span class='fss'>B</span></a> and <a href='#pl133'>133</a>). This climax is so closely associated with the decorative
and architectural development called Art Nouveau that the later Continental department
stores may better be discussed in connexion with that
(see Chapters <a href='#ch16'>16</a>, <a href='#ch17'>17</a>).
Being of exposed metal, however, not of masonry-sheathed ‘skyscraper construction’
and relatively low, these stores are closer in character to the cast-iron commercial
buildings of the third quarter of the century in America and Britain than to the tall
Chicago structures of 1890-1910.</p>

<p class='c010'>Steel construction of the American type, with the internal skeleton carrying a protective
cladding of masonry, has gradually spread since the opening of the century to
all parts of the world that produce or can afford to buy structural steel. It was, for
example, introduced into London by the Anglo-French architects Mewès &amp; Davis in
building the Ritz Hotel there in 1905. Yet it remains typically American. In most other
countries reinforced concrete rivals or completely takes its place as the characteristic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>material for building large structures of all sorts. The story of reinforced concrete had its
technical beginnings in the mid nineteenth century; but it was not before the nineties
that it first began to be exploited on a large scale and for conscious architectural effect.
The first important reinforced concrete buildings, French like most of the best department
stores of around 1900, will be mentioned later (see Chapter <a href='#ch18'>18</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole picture of architecture in the twentieth century, so different from the picture
of architecture before 1850, was modified by the developments that culminated
in the Chicago skyscrapers. However important this has been for all later architecture
both technically and aesthetically, it is important to stress here, as with the mid-century
monuments of iron and glass, that the successive stages in the development are not
solely, or even primarily, of premonitory and historical interest. From Parris’s granite
buildings in Boston of the twenties, through the arcaded English commercial work of
the fifties and sixties, to Richardson’s Field store and Sullivan’s skyscrapers in Chicago,
St Louis, Buffalo, and New York, enlightened commercial patrons demanded and often
received the best architecture of their day. The functional and technical challenges of
commercial building seem to have brought out the creative capacities of three generations
of architects as no other commissions did so consistently. Compare Parris’s Grecian
temple church, St Paul’s in Boston, with his granite ‘skeleton’ fronts beside the Quincy
Market (Plate <a href='#pl112b'>112<span class='fss'>B</span></a>); set Godwin’s Stokes Croft Warehouse beside his town halls
(<a href='#pl133'>Plates 113</a> and <a href='#pl092a'>92<span class='fss'>A</span></a>); measure Richardson’s Field store even against his Pittsburgh Jail
(<a href='#pl116b'>Plates 116<span class='fss'>B</span></a> and <a href='#pl108b'>108<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Then the strictly <i>architectural</i>, as well as the technical and social,
significance of the major commercial monuments of the nineteenth century will be
evident.</p>

<p class='c010'>This chapter has summarized what was probably the greatest single innovation in
nineteenth-century architecture, the rise of a new type of building to a position of
prestige and of achievement comparable to that of churches and palaces in earlier
periods. The same cannot be said of domestic architecture. The house was hardly a nineteenth-century
invention like the office building. It was, however, modified almost beyond
recognition as the century progressed, at the hands of several generations of
creative architects. Around 1900 there are few if any churches, for example, to rival
Sullivan’s skyscrapers in quality; but there are some houses, especially several by his
disciple Wright and by his English contemporary Voysey.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>In</span> the long story of man’s dwellings from prehistory to the present, the Anglo-American
development that took place in the hundred years between the 1790s and the 1890s
is of considerable significance, particularly as it provides the immediate background of
the twentieth-century house. Architectural history has generally been little concerned,
in dealing with periods earlier than the eighteenth century at least, with the habitations
of any but the upper classes. The study of rural cottages in various regions of the world
has been more a matter for anthropological investigation; the housing of the urban
poor, when that was other than the makeshift adaptation of grander structures fallen
into decay, remains for most early periods a matter of mystery. We know that ancient
Rome had its blocks of middle-class flats of many storeys; although the links are not easy
to recover, there was certainly some continuity in Mediterranean lands between that
form of urban housing in antiquity and what can be traced from the medieval period
down to the nineteenth century. Northern Europe in the late Middle Ages saw rather
the development of individual urban dwellings with party walls, ancestors of the terrace-houses
that first appeared in England in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p class='c010'>The detached house of moderate size, so familiar today, the principal type of dwelling
to undergo notable development in the nineteenth century in Anglo-Saxon countries,
has no such remote Classical origins as the Continental flat or apartment. It made its
appearance as the dwelling of the yeoman when economic conditions in late medieval
England encouraged the rise of a class between the feudal landowner and the peasant
parallel to the skilled artisan class in the towns. The conditions of settlement of the
British colonies in America, particularly in New England, encouraged the continuation
through the seventeenth century of this type of dwelling almost to the exclusion of
any other sort, since towns were then small and large estates rare. Around 1700 in
America, though considerably earlier in England, relatively advanced contemporary
modes began to have some influence on the design of such houses. With a lag of as
much as a quarter of a century, the architectural developments of the home country
were generally followed in the colonies; nor did political independence much affect the
dependent cultural relationship in this field after the American Revolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>The effects of the Picturesque point of view on the development of the house in England
around 1800 were several (see Chapter <a href='#ch06'>6</a>). On the one hand, the newly fashionable
attitude gave prestige to modest detached dwellings, raising the social status of the
‘cottage’ from an agricultural labourer’s hovel to a middle-class habitation or even on
occasion a holiday ‘retreat’ for the upper classes—at first by adding the French adjective
<i>orné</i> (Plate <a href='#pl122a'>122<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). At the same time the status of the ‘villa’ tended to be reduced from a
large Italianate mansion on its own estate to a moderate-sized house at the edge of town.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>In much of the prolific architectural literature of the period, the hierarchy of residential
building types was Rousseauistically inverted as rustic models, both native and Italian,
were proposed for emulation in edifices of fairly considerable size. Thus several modes
of informal design that had made their eighteenth-century debut in garden ornaments
received more serious attention from architects as they came to be considered suitable
for medium-sized dwellings and even sometimes for quite large mansions. As we have
already seen, the towered Italian Villa was first introduced as a modest detached house
by Nash at Cronkhill in 1802. It was similarly utilized by Schinkel (Plate <a href='#pl014a'>14<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) and
Persius at Potsdam a generation later, although Royalty still preferred to dwell there
in Grecian dignity or Castellated pomp (see Chapter <a href='#ch02'>2</a>). Somewhat later, however,
the Italian Villa provided (none too happily) a Royal retreat when Prince Albert
decided on this mode for Osborne House on the Isle of Wight in the mid forties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not all Picturesque modes were equally adaptable to middle-class dwellings. The
Indian found its most notable realizations in a large country house, S. P. Cockerell’s
Sezincote, and a Royal folly, Nash’s Brighton Pavilion (Plate <a href='#pl048'>48</a>). There were, however,
considerably later American examples<a id="r322"></a><a href='#f322' class='c025'><sup>[322]</sup></a> on a somewhat more modest scale, such as
Iranistan at Bridgeport, Conn., built for Barnum in 1847-8, and Longwood, near
Natchez in Mississippi, designed by Samuel Sloan in 1860 that have been mentioned
earlier. But the Indian mode contributed the veranda, henceforth an integral feature
of American domestic architecture, though rare after the Picturesque period in England.
Verandas very early lost the Oriental detail, however. In front of Rustic Cottages
they were often supported by bark-covered logs, but they could also acquire the formal
character of Italian loggias, Tudor arcades, Swiss galleries or, most frequently, Classical
porticoes and ‘pilastrades’ when adapted for use with other current modes.<a id="r323"></a><a href='#f323' class='c025'><sup>[323]</sup></a> In some
cases the veranda, carried on occasion to two storeys in height, became the main theme
of the exterior, yet was detailed so simply that no modish name
properly applies (Plate <a href='#pl122a'>122<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Even the Castellated mode, although used mostly for rather large houses (Plate <a href='#pl049'>49</a>),
encouraged loose asymmetrical massing of the sort that is still more characteristic of the
towered Italian Villa.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Picturesque was thoroughly eclectic, in both possible senses of the word, as well
as occasionally original. On the one hand, the point of view encouraged the parallel use
of diverse modes. In theory, these were to be chosen according to their suitability to
various sorts of natural settings, but in practice several were often employed side by
side, as in Nash’s Park Villages in London, begun in 1827, and in the contemporary and
later development of comparable suburban areas both in England and in America. On
the other hand, the combination in one design of features derived from several different
modes was allowable, even praiseworthy—low-pitched roofs with very broad eaves
borrowed from the Swiss Chalet, towers from both the Castellated Mansion and the
Italian Villa, bay-windows from the Tudor Parsonage, and verandas from the Indian
were all part of a common repertory exploited rather indiscriminately. Basic to the
Picturesque point of view and often determinant of choice of mode and even of individual
features was the preoccupation with the natural setting; verandas, loggias,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>bay-windows and prospect towers were desirable, even necessary, features because they
made possible the fuller enjoyment of the circumambient scene.</p>

<div id='i255'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i255.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 21. T. F. Hunt: house-plan<br />(from <i>Designs for Parsonage Houses</i>, 1827)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>All these features affected house-plans in detail; but domestic planning in general
was not as consistently re-organized as might have been expected, if only because the
Picturesque point of view was so predominantly visual rather than practical in its usual
concerns. Asymmetrical massing allowed, even forced, asymmetrical planning, however,
thereby encouraging functional differentiation of the disposition and the sizes of various
rooms (Figure <a href='#i255'>21</a>). Yet very often, behind irregular exteriors, the plans were only
slightly dislocated from the formal patterns of the preceding Palladian period. Although
the increased articulation of most house-plans allowed the introduction of windows on
several sides of many rooms, more significant at this stage was the frequent use of irregular
shapes for the larger rooms, their main rectangular spaces complicated by external
oriels and by internal ingle-nooks. None of these individual changes can be very precisely
dated, at least in the current state of knowledge of the development of the house-plan
in this period. Almost all of them were generally familiar in England by 1810.
Tudor Parsonages, whether or not occupied by members of the clergy, were likely to
be most adeptly planned.<a id="r324"></a><a href='#f324' class='c025'><sup>[324]</sup></a> In them the well-defined needs of a family of relatively high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>social status but low income encouraged a more efficient grouping of the rooms and
a clearer distinction of separate functions—entrance hall, drawing-room, dining-room,
study, kitchen, scullery—than had been common earlier in such medium-sized
dwellings.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the first third of the century the various Picturesque modes of house-design were
very widely exploited in England for middle-class habitations in the new suburbs, having
generally made their first appearance a decade or so earlier in lodges or other accessories
to large private estates. They were also popular at the new seaside resorts, such as Sidmouth
in Devon and Bournemouth in Hampshire, where they often housed more
exalted clients. At Sidmouth, for example, what is now the Woodlands Hotel was remodelled
from a barn into a barge-boarded Cottage Orné by Lord Gwydyr in 1815; the
nucleus of the Knowles Hotel there was Lord Despenser’s cottage of a few years earlier;
and the Royal Glen Hotel, a modest Castellated house then known as Walbrook Cottage,
was built early enough to house Queen Victoria as a baby. Although the prestige
of the Picturesque declined rapidly in high aesthetic circles after 1840, the rigorous principles
of Pugin and the ecclesiologists had little effect on the operations of suburban
builders, who continued for decades to follow the various well-established modes of a
generation earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Latrobe’s ‘Gothick’ Sedgley, built outside Philadelphia in 1798, and various other
Neo-Gothic structures in Philadelphia and Boston of the first decade of the new century
make evident, the Picturesque came early to the United States. Yet it was hardly before
the thirties that the various Cottage and Villa modes began to compete at all with the
Greek temple and the formal post-Palladian house modernized by the use of Grecian
detail; only with the appearance in 1842 of <i>Cottage Residences</i> by A. J. Downing (1815-52)<a id="r325"></a><a href='#f325' class='c025'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
were they enthusiastically propagated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Earlier, new developments in the planning of the ubiquitous moderate-sized free-standing
houses were not very notable in America. In the 1790s the influence of Adam,
and possibly of the French, encouraged some experimentation with variously shaped
rooms; but this largely died out as the necessary rectangularity of the Greek temple
house, only extended by one or more wings in the largest examples, reimposed the formal
Anglo-Palladian plan with central stair-hall and four nearly equal-sized corner
rooms. For smaller houses with pedimented fronts, however, a sort of terrace-house plan
was increasingly popular, with stair-hall at one side, two principal living rooms one behind
the other, and a narrower kitchen wing extending to the rear. A planning innovation
that first appeared in America in the 1790s, by no means unknown earlier in England
but rare except in terrace-houses, was the opening together of two rooms—front and
back parlours—by means of broad sliding doors. This became increasingly common after
1800. Moreover, the temple portico provided the equivalent of a shallow veranda
across the front of the house and was sometimes replaced or supplemented by a deeper
colonnaded porch at the sides or rear. The veranda, indeed, had reached the southern
states fairly early in the eighteenth century, arriving from the East via the West Indies.
In its usual two-storeyed form it was easily merged with the monumental colonnades
demanded by the Grecian mode (Plate <a href='#pl038b'>38<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Thus, even before a rather belated wave of strong Picturesque influence began to drive
out the temple house in the forties, early nineteenth-century American houses had certain
definitely post-Colonial characteristics in their plans. Of later house-planning in the
United States in the forties and fifties almost everything that has been said about English
planning in the preceding decades applies (Figure <a href='#i258'>22</a>). By this time in England, however,
newer planning ideas were being introduced by leading architects in relatively
large houses. At Scarisbrick, for example, where the remodelling and extension of the
existing Georgian house began in 1837, Pugin revived the medieval great hall (see
Chapter 6). A few years later in his own house, The Grange of 1841-3 at Ramsgate,<a id="r326"></a><a href='#f326' class='c025'><sup>[326]</sup></a> by
no means a mansion in size or scale, the more modest two-storey hall incorporates the
staircase and also provides, with the galleries above, the central core of communication.
Parallel with these examples, which were of Gothic inspiration, Barry at Highclere
adapted the glass-roofed central <i>cortile</i> of the Reform Club to domestic use, associating
with it the main staircase rising in a contiguous vertical space.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the hands of High Church architects the parsonage, by definition no mansion but
a modest free-standing gentleman’s residence, was also undergoing a characteristic development.
No longer Tudor, of course, it was still not forced to be archaeologically
decorated in its planning, since there were few if any relevant medieval models to
imitate. The doctrine of ‘realism’ condemned the shabby construction and careless
use of materials that had too often been characteristic of Picturesque house-building in
the previous decades, while the need for economy discouraged the ornamentation common
on contemporary churches.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such a vicarage as that which Butterfield built in 1844-5 to go with his ‘first’ church,
St Saviour’s at Coalpitheath, Gloucestershire, is a model of simple masonry construction.
In the random ashlar walls are set wide banks of plain mullioned windows, Gothic
only in the arching of their heads, where they can serve best to light the various rooms
(Plate <a href='#pl122b'>122<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The massing also is irregular yet orderly with several high gables, a porch,
many tall chimney stacks, and a broad bow-window elaborating the basically rectangular
block. But, in the language of the ecclesiologists, ‘the true Picturesque derives
from the sternest utility’, and so all these projecting features were such as could be
readily justified functionally, like the ritualistic articulation of contemporary churches.
The plan of Butterfield’s vicarage has the virtues of those of the Picturesque Tudor Parsonages
in the variety of room-sizes and shapes provided and also in the opportunities
that the windows offer to enjoy surrounding nature. There is also at Coalpitheath a very
modest version of Pugin’s stair-hall at The Grange, not a mere lobby but a central space
designed for easy horizontal and vertical communication.</p>

<p class='c010'>Any serious revival of medieval craftsmanship in masonry was all but impossible in
America; in any case it was largely irrelevant in a land where most houses were built of
wood. But in reaction to the white-painted clapboards and the smooth Grecian trim of
the previous decades, echoing however humbly the marble of Greece, Downing in the
early forties proposed and many at his behest adopted variant treatments for the exterior
sheathing of Picturesque villas and cottages that were rather more expressive.
The distinguished native craftsmanship evident in the more monumental edifices of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>the Greek Revival executed in fine ashlar of granite or other light-coloured stone, or
else in smooth red brick, died out. Such materials had no more appeal than did crisp
white-painted wood to a generation indoctrinated with the Picturesque point of view.
Yet clapboards remained the usual surfacing material for wooden houses, even if they
were now painted, not white, but in the stony hues—grey or beige—that Downing
recommended in his books with actual coloured samples.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The treatment Downing preferred was board-and-batten.<a id="r327"></a><a href='#f327' class='c025'><sup>[327]</sup></a> This he made a constituent
element of the very original Bracketted mode that he offered as an American
alternative to the imported Italian Villa and Tudor Parsonage which he was energetically
engaged in nationalizing. Board-and-batten provides a stronger pattern of light and
shade, and also the verticalism that appealed increasingly to mid-century taste. This
sheathing also offers a sort of symbolic expression of the light ‘balloon-frame’<a id="r328"></a><a href='#f328' class='c025'><sup>[328]</sup></a> construction
that was beginning to come into general use by the fifties, though this method
of wooden framing was apparently never known to Downing, since he died in 1852
before it reached the eastern states where he lived and worked.</p>

<p class='c010'>With their board-and-batten walls, their ample verandas, and their bay-windows,
what are still usually called ‘Downing houses’ constitute a largely original American
creation in spite of the frequent use of Tudoresque detail on barge-boards and veranda
supports and even of elaborately moulded terracotta chimney pots. Yet in their planning
the houses designed by Downing and his architect friends Davis and Notman do not advance
much beyond the models published in the English books of the previous decades
that were their immediate prototypes (Figure <a href='#i258'>22</a>). The verandas are usually wider and
more prominent, however, and the front and rear parlours are likely to open into one
another, as sometimes also into a modest central hall.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>In America as in England, the Picturesque period came to no sudden end. The recurrent
publication of Downing’s books even after the Civil War<a id="r329"></a><a href='#f329' class='c025'><sup>[329]</sup></a> indicates how long his
models remained favourites with American builders and their small-town and suburban
clients. However, even before the Civil War a mansarded Second Empire mode was
beginning to become popular (see Chapter <a href='#ch09'>9</a>). With the wide acceptance of this
and of the High Victorian Gothic there developed a rather sharp split between autochthonous
and imported types of house-design, drastically though the imported types were
usually Americanized outside the bigger eastern cities. To this situation we must return
later.</p>

<p class='c010'>Something has already been said of the major turn that took place in the development
of the English house around 1860 (see Chapters <a href='#ch09'>9</a> and <a href='#ch12'>12</a>). When seen in relation to the
parsonages that his master Street and also Butterfield had been building in the
previous fifteen years, Webb’s Red House built in 1859-60 for William Morris is considerably
less revolutionary than has sometimes been supposed. Had this been built in
Gloucestershire rather than in Kent, it would certainly have been of stone like Butterfield’s
Coalpitheath Vicarage; as it is, the entrance porch is no simpler or less Gothic than
Butterfield’s. The particular window forms, moreover, can be matched in Butterfield’s
Clergy House and School at All Saints’, Margaret Street, and the somewhat rustic ease
of composition in his cottages at Baldersby St James. Yet the planning here is highly individual,
suited to the special needs of a client who was an artist and a writer, not a
parson.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next house that Webb built, now known as Benfleet Hall, Cobham, begun in
1860 for the painter Spencer Stanhope, has been less publicized, and it never had the rich
furnishings that Morris and his associates designed and executed for the Red House. Yet
it is perhaps more significant in the general history of the Anglo-American house. There
is here, for example, a small stair-hall of the order of Pugin’s at the Grange or Butterfield’s
at Coalpitheath around which the other ground-storey rooms are loosely
grouped. The particular character of the plan can, in fact, best be matched at Hinderton,
a small country house in Cheshire that is hardly more of a mansion than Benfleet, which
Waterhouse built in 1859. This house is in Waterhouse’s gawkiest High Victorian
Gothic, with none of the simplicity and delicacy of Webb’s early houses. It is rather
unlikely that Webb was actually emulating it, but the plan was twice published<a id="r330"></a><a href='#f330' class='c025'><sup>[330]</sup></a> and
hence soon known abroad.</p>

<p class='c010'>Webb’s Arisaig in Inverness-shire was begun in 1863 (Figure <a href='#i260'>23</a>). Built of local
stone, it is somewhat more conventionally Gothic externally; moreover, it is of country-house
size, a mansion rather than a modest artist’s dwelling like the Red House or
Benfleet Hall. The plan has two major aspects of interest: the two-storeyed hall, with
gallery above, occupies a central position and the principal rooms on both storeys are
very efficiently grouped about it within the bounding rectangle of the main block of the
house. In other words, Arisaig’s hall seems to derive as much from the Highclere sort of
glazed central court as from Pugin’s revival of the medieval great hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cloverley Hall, which was built by Nesfield and Shaw in 1865-8, attracted much
favourable contemporary attention largely because of the superb craftsmanship of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>brickwork and the originality of the <i>japoniste</i> ornament (see Chapter <a href='#ch12'>12</a>). It is destroyed
now except for the extensive service and stable wings and the gate lodge; but the amount
and the character of the fenestration, providing in some areas what amounted to window-walls
of stone-mullioned and transomed lights, and the character of the plan make it still
memorable. It was also the first of the many notable Late Victorian manor houses which
both Nesfield and Shaw would build when working alone.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Like Arisaig, Cloverley was a large country house. The medieval great hall, first rather
modestly revived by Pugin at Scarisbrick, here returned at full scale; but it was placed
in a corner of the main block—as was occasionally its position in the sixteenth century—so
that it might receive light from one end as well as from the side (Figure <a href='#i261'>24</a>). From the
entrance, however, one passed by this hall through the ‘screens’ under a gallery to
arrive at a stair-hall, more in the manner of Waterhouse’s and Webb’s, around which
the other principal rooms were compactly grouped. There was also here a very skilful
play with levels, the hall being lower than the rest of the main floor, and therefore
part-way down to the basement—containing a billiard room and so forth—which was
entirely above ground at the rear of the house.</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 24. Nesfield &amp; Shaw: Cloverley Hall, Shropshire, 1865-8, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>While Cloverley Hall was still in construction, Shaw had begun his own personal
career as a house-builder at Glen Andred in 1866-7 (Plate <a href='#pl102b'>102<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), where he introduced
a more vernacular manner (see Chapter <a href='#ch12'>12</a>). Following this came his Leyswood in
1868-9, a mansion as large as Cloverley Hall and in some of its decorative features
more archaeologically Late Medieval. As at Cloverley Hall, the amplitude of the fenestration,
however, arranged here in long mullioned bands as well as in tall window-walls,
has seemed more significant to posterity than the stylistic detailing<a id="r331"></a><a href='#f331' class='c025'><sup>[331]</sup></a> (Plate <a href='#pl123'>123</a>). Above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>all, Leyswood marked a further stage in the development of the ‘agglutinative plan’
(Figure <a href='#i210'>19</a>), of which the first well-publicized example was Waterhouse’s at Hinderton.
Here the great hall and the stair-hall of Cloverley are combined to form a central spatial
core of communication, somewhat as at Webb’s Arisaig, but the shape of this is quite
irregular and the reception rooms are grouped very loosely about it, more as at Benfleet
Hall. Projecting well out of the main block, the dining-room and the drawing-room
both receive light from three sides. Moreover, the space of these rooms is articulated,
as in certain Picturesque houses of forty and fifty years earlier, by ingle-nooks, oriels,
and various other irregularities. Perspectives of Leyswood—not the plan<a id="r332"></a><a href='#f332' class='c025'><sup>[332]</sup></a>—were
published in the supplement to the <i>Building News</i> of 31 March 1871 and made at once
a tremendous impression both in England and in America (Plate <a href='#pl123'>123</a>).</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 25. Philip Webb: Barnet, Hertfordshire, Trevor Hall,<br />1868-70, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In a house by Webb of the same date as Leyswood, Trevor Hall at Oakleigh Park,
Barnet, in Hertfordshire, the arrangement of the rooms about the central hall was much
more compact (Figure <a href='#i262'>25</a>). The whole formed a square and allowed a quite symmetrical
treatment of the three principal fronts. This house is now destroyed except for the gate
lodge. Less interesting in plan but significant for its very modest size is Webb’s
Upwood Gorse, Caterham, Surrey, built for Queen Victoria’s dentist Sir John Tomes
also in 1868. The consistency and the simplicity with which the local vernacular of
brick below and tile-hanging above is handled in connexion with plenty of white-painted
Queen Anne sash-windows regularly but not symmetrically spaced offers a
curiously close prototype of the American ‘Shingle Style’, although the initiators of
that mode a decade later can hardly have known of this house, since it was never published.
It was rather Shaw’s houses of the next decade, of which his drawings were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>exhibited each year at the Royal Academy and given great prominence in the professional
Press, that provided the exemplars which architects generally imitated both at
home and abroad; from 1874 on the plans were usually illustrated as well as Shaw’s
own very virtuoso pen-drawn<a id="r333"></a><a href='#f333' class='c025'><sup>[333]</sup></a> perspectives (Plate <a href='#pl123'>123</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Webb’s houses for the painters Val Prinsep and G. B. Boyce in Kensington and
Chelsea, of 1865 and 1869 respectively, were the first English ‘studio-houses’—houses,
that is, in which the studios, naturally equipped with very large windows, were the
principal rooms. These provided a more livable alternative to the great halls that Shaw
generally provided in his country houses; but it was the larger artists’ houses of the
seventies and eighties which Shaw built for his fellow academicians that received
contemporary publicity.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the mid seventies Shaw was moving in the formal and symmetrical direction
initiated by Webb at Trevor Hall and soon carried much further by Nesfield at Kinmel
Park as regards both the planning and the external organization of his larger London
houses. Lowther Lodge in Kensington Gore of 1873-4 is the first of his domestic commissions
that may properly be called Queen Anne rather than Manorial. The even more
formally designed Cheyne House and Old Swan House, of 1875 and 1876 respectively,
on the Chelsea Embankment followed shortly after (Plate <a href='#pl103'>103</a>); but he long continued
to build more loosely composed houses in the country, as has been noted earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before turning to the results of Shaw’s very notable influence in the United States in
the seventies, something should be said of the situation there in the preceding decade.
The Second Empire mode had been increasingly popular for houses from the mid
fifties and was especially fashionable during the boom period that followed the Civil
War. It had no positive contribution to make to the general Anglo-American development
in these decades, however. In the domestic field more or less Gothic modes were
its significant rivals; first Downing’s wide-veranda-ed version of the Tudor Cottage;
then, after 1860, what Vincent Scully has christened the ‘Stick Style’.<a id="r334"></a><a href='#f334' class='c025'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>On houses in this mode, which is really hardly Gothic at all, a sort of imitation half-timbering
panels the exterior walls, suggesting, like Downing’s board-and-batten
sheathing, the underlying wooden stud-structure of balloon-frame construction. This
construction came to be generally used in the East as well as in the Middle West, where
it originated, after it had been explained by William E. Bell in his <i>Carpentry Made Easy</i>
in 1858. More striking is the open stickwork of the ubiquitous verandas. This can be
seen in an early form on the Olmsted house in East Hartford, Conn., of 1849 by the
English architect Gervase Wheeler,<a id="r335"></a><a href='#f335' class='c025'><sup>[335]</sup></a> who obviously derived it from Picturesque models
in England dating back at least to the thirties. In the J. N. H. Griswold house of 1862 in
Bellevue Avenue in Newport, R.I., by the French-trained Hunt, now the Newport Art
Association, the ‘sticks’ of the wall surface are so sturdy that they may well be the actual
framing members.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very characteristic of the maturity of the mode is the Sturtevant house at nearby
Middletown, R.I., built by Dudley Newton (1845?-1907) a decade later in 1872. Here
the gawky vigour of the Stick Style, its intense woodenness, and its descent from several
different Picturesque modes—not least the Swiss Chalet—is very evident (Plate <a href='#pl124a'>124<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Extensive surrounding verandas are of the very essence of the mode; but the internal
planning, while informal and often asymmetrical, is rarely very open. Several books by
Eugene C. Gardner (1836-1905)<a id="r336"></a><a href='#f336' class='c025'><sup>[336]</sup></a> of Springfield, Mass., give a sophisticated architect’s
rationale of the mode. But the exemplars that G. E. Woodward<a id="r337"></a><a href='#f337' class='c025'><sup>[337]</sup></a> offered in the sixties
are more typical, and were more widely imitated in actual production; for the Stick Style
had almost run its course by the time Gardner began to present his excellent house designs.
Woodward was no architect, and for the most part the Stick Style should not be considered
an architect’s mode. It represented rather a popular attempt, remarkably successful
for a few years, to create an American domestic vernacular, suited to the materials in
general use and to the current methods of building, comparable to Downing’s earlier
Bracketted mode. Like the Second Empire vogue the Stick Style died out, at least in the
East, during the general hiatus in building production after the financial Panic of 1873.</p>

<p class='c010'>By that time Shaw’s influence had begun to reach America.<a id="r338"></a><a href='#f338' class='c025'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Moreover, the possibilities
of agglutinative planning about a great hall had been realized by Richardson well
before a Shaw plan—that for Hopedene—was first made available in the <i>Building News</i>
in 1874. It is, of course, possible that McKim, in passing through England on his way
home from Paris in 1870, had seen (or merely heard of) the character of Webb’s, Nesfield’s,
and Shaw’s houses of the sixties and transmitted that information to Richardson.</p>

<p class='c010'>An undated project of about 1871 by Richardson for a house to be built in Newport,
R.I., for Richard Codman includes his first great hall<a id="r339"></a><a href='#f339' class='c025'><sup>[339]</sup></a> of the Shavian sort; but the
Codman plan is already in advance of, or at least rather different from, those of Shaw.
This hall, out of which the stairs would rise in an
<span class="sans">L</span>-shaped
at the rear, was to be very large in
relation to the other rooms, and thus definitely a principal living area not a mere foyer
or centre of circulation. The drawing room and dining room were to open out of the
hall through wide doorways so that some sort of spatial continuity would have extended
through all the reception rooms of the ground storey. There was to be a large veranda
at the rear in the well-established local tradition. The exterior as shown in the elevations
is not at all Shavian but rather related to the Stick Style, like Richardson’s own
house at Arrochar on Staten Island of 1868.</p>

<p class='c010'>Richardson’s first executed country house, the F. W. Andrews house of 1872-3 at
Newport, R.I., was much more Shavian in plan. Four or five rooms were grouped
about a relatively smaller central stair-hall and most of these were articulated by bay-windows
and ingle-nooks. But the main block was also surrounded by verandas,
features which are rare and always of modest extent on Shaw’s houses. The Andrews
house was burned a long time ago, but from the existing elevations it would appear that
the external treatment represented a sort of transition between the Stick Style, then at
its apogee, and Shaw’s Surrey vernacular translated into American materials. The
verandas were still detailed in a Stick Style way, and flat stickwork interrupted the continuity
of the wall surfaces; but the clapboarding of the lower walls evidently took the
place of the brickwork Shaw used—it was almost certainly painted red—and the wooden
shingling of the upper walls was a happy substitute for English tile-hanging. Shingles
were, of course, an old though largely forgotten American sheathing material long used
especially for roofs.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>By the time Richardson came to design his next large house, that for William Watts
Sherman on Shepard Avenue in Newport in 1874, the perspectives of several of Shaw’s
manors had appeared in the <i>Building News</i> and the plans of two. As a result, probably,
of his assistant Stanford White’s Shaw-like skill with the pencil, the Sherman house was
notably Shavian externally. Above the ground storey, which is of Richardsonian
random-ashlar masonry in pink Milford granite with brownstone trim, the walls and
the high roofs are covered with shingles cut in various decorative shapes suggested by
those of Shaw’s tile-hanging. Many of the casement windows are grouped to form
window-walls in the ground storey and arranged in long horizontal bands above. The
half-timbering of the front gable, with painted decoration on the intervening plaster,
was taken straight from Shaw’s Grim’s Dyke; the carved ornament on the barge-boards
is almost Nesfieldian in its suggestion of <i>japonisme</i>. Thus the whole is as perfect a specimen
of Shaw’s Manorial mode as anything any architect other than he or Nesfield ever
produced in England. The house has since been much enlarged, partly by White in 1881,
partly by Newton very much later, but always with due respect for the character of the
original design.</p>

<p class='c010'>The plan has more of the independent virtues of that of the Codman project. The
hall provides a principal portion of the living area, and the other main rooms open into
it through wide doors; thus there is some flow of space throughout the whole original
block. The original library at the rear corner, later replaced by a large ballroom, ended
in a Shavian rounded bay with a continuous window band, a feature Wright would
copy later. Yet otherwise the house was less articulated than Shaw’s earlier ones,
having rather the compactness though none of the symmetry of Webb’s Trevor Hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mid seventies saw many other American reflections of Shaw’s Manorial mode
and soon of his Queen Anne also, none of them so successful as the Sherman house. But
the deep business recession that followed the Panic of 1873 led to a general mood of repentance
after the extravagances, architectural and otherwise, of the post-war boom.
From the resultant nostalgia for the simpler ways of the American past there began to
develop at this time a great interest in the houses of the Colonial period, an interest that
readily merged, however, with the current English preoccupation with the vernacular
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. To an extent difficult for posterity to appreciate,
the nascent ‘Shingle Style’,<a id="r340"></a><a href='#f340' class='c025'><sup>[340]</sup></a> which crystallized towards the end of the decade
with the revival of building production, was to its protagonists already a sort of Colonial
Revival. Although its origins are partly Shavian, it represents above all a reaction, as did
Shaw’s Manorial mode in England, against the ‘modernism’ of the High Victorian
Gothic and the Second Empire, now grown thoroughly unfashionable except in the
West.</p>

<p class='c010'>Boston was still the architectural metropolis of the United States, and it was around
Boston, especially in the work of Emerson and Little, the latter a serious early student
of old Colonial work, that this crystallization of the Shingle Style first took place (see
Chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>). But it was at once taken over and given a somewhat more Shaw-like elaboration
by the New York firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White, formed in 1879. From the early
eighties, and for over a decade, the Shingle Style was widely practised by architects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>from coast to coast, and not least happily in the Far West. The characteristic use of
shingles as an all-over wall-covering emphasized the continuity of the exterior surface
as a skin stretched over the underlying wooden skeleton of studs, in contrast to the way
the preceding Stick Style had echoed that skeleton in the external treatment. The
shingles properly provide the name for a most characteristically American domestic
mode; but it was in planning that American architects made the really original contribution
in what was the most significant development of the detached house since the
Picturesque period.</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 26. W. R. Emerson: Mount Desert, Maine, house, 1879, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>One of the first mature examples of the Shingle Style, a house built by Emerson on
Mount Desert in Maine in 1879, well illustrates the virtuosity of the new planning
(Figure <a href='#i266'>26</a>). Rooms of varied shape and size are loosely grouped about the hall and open
freely into one another. The various levels of the different areas are related to the landing
levels of the elaborate staircase. Above all, it should be noted that the verandas are
not mere adjuncts or afterthoughts, as they were even on Richardson’s Andrews house,
but major elements, both space-wise and visually, of the whole composition. Such
houses parallel in their three-dimensional complexity the massing of the Italian Villas
of the earlier nineteenth-century decades with their loggias, pergolas, and prospect
towers, yet they bear little or no visual resemblance to them, since the later houses are
always much more sculpturally plastic and less articulated in composition. The windows
are generally of double-hung small-paned sashes of a type at once Queen Anne and
Colonial, but they are frequently grouped in the Shavian way, as well as being ingeniously
placed in order to vary the internal lighting effects, so that the pattern of
fenestration is not at all of an eighteenth-century order.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Richardson certainly did not initiate the Shingle Style; but he took it over in 1880
and made it very much his own, using it for all his later country and suburban houses.
Dropping all detail, whether Richardsonian Romanesque, Shavian Manorial, Queen
Anne, or American Colonial, he retained much of the ease and casualness of Shaw’s best
early houses. But there is also a great deal of similarity to the simple massive effects of
the old Colonial houses also. Spiritually, so to say, if not so much visually, Richardson’s
shingled houses most resemble Webb’s best work; of these Richardson presumably had
no knowledge, although it is just possible that he might have seen some when he was in
England in 1882, well after the Shingle Style was fully established.</p>

<p class='c010'>Richardson’s Stoughton house in Brattle Street in Cambridge, Mass., of 1882-3 is
perhaps his best shingled one, at least in the relatively untouched form in which it,
almost alone, alas, has come down to us (Plate <a href='#pl124b'>124<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). It certainly shows little evidence of
the interest that he is known to have taken in Burges’s and Shaw’s work while he
was abroad just before this. The entrance, originally, was through the loggia recessed
into the main mass of the house (it is now from Ash Street on the left). The living-hall
extends, as in the Sherman house, from front to back and the stairs sweep up in a quarter-circle
over the entrance. The drawing room at the corner and the dining room behind
the loggia both open into the hall through wide doors; only the small library is isolated
from the general flow of space. Externally, the shingled surfaces, broken only by banks
of double-hung windows, model the complex mass into a unified composition, the
almost submerged stair-tower successfully linking the two gabled wings at right angles to
one another by its rounded form. There is no ornament of any sort, and the weathered
grey of the shingles is varied only by the dark-green paint of the window sash.</p>

<p class='c010'>McKim, Mead &amp; White’s houses of the early eighties, several of them equally fine,
are usually rather more elaborate in their massing and are likely to be enlivened with
much imaginative detail.<a id="r341"></a><a href='#f341' class='c025'><sup>[341]</sup></a> Some of the detail recalls this or that style of the past, but all
of it is thoroughly personalized by White’s delicate hand. One of their best houses is the
one for Isaac Bell, Jr, built in 1881-2 in Bellevue Avenue in Newport,
R.I. (Plate #126:pl126). This is less unified externally than the Stoughton
house but more open in plan
(Figure <a href='#i268'>27</a>). A wide veranda, with very elegant bamboo-like supports, extends around
two fronts, expanding into a two-storeyed open pavilion on the right. This pavilion
provides a semicircular void to balance the round tower at the rear left corner. The
patterns of the original cut shingles on this house, although obviously suggested by
English tiling, are much softer and more graceful, almost bringing to mind birds’
plumage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Inside, the hall is articulated by a wide ingle-nook, rather dark and low, in sharpest
contrast to the great flight of stairs beyond down which floods light from the window-wall
at the half landing. Twenty-five-foot sliding doors, hung from above, make it
possible to open the drawing room through almost its entire length into the hall. The
Bell dining room, connecting at its end through French windows with the curved
portion of the veranda, has some of the finest of White’s orientalizing detail. This is
much more original than that in the new library he decorated at this time in the Sherman
house or the dining room he added to Upjohn’s Kingscote, both also in Newport.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>McKim, Mead &amp; White’s slightly earlier H. Victor Newcomb house of 1880-1 in
Elberon, N.J., is at once clumsier and more Shavian externally than the Bell house; but
the spatial treatment of the living-hall is most original and very significant for later
developments (Plate <a href='#pl125a'>125<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The main rectangular space, of which the shape is emphasized
by the ceiling beams and by the abstract geometrical pattern of the floor, seems
to flow out in various directions into other rooms and into several bays and nooks; but
the actual room-space is sharply defined by a continuous frieze-like member that becomes
an open wooden grille above the various openings. There can be little question
that the major influence here is from the Japanese<a id="r342"></a><a href='#f342' class='c025'><sup>[342]</sup></a> interior, but from the Japanese interior
understood as architecture. This is not just a superficial matter of Nesfieldian
<i>japonisme</i> such as White was employing so much in his ornament in these years. The
Kingscote dining room has somewhat similar spatial qualities but more eclectic detailing
and richer materials: marble, Tiffany glass tiles, cork panels, stained glass, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1879 Cyrus McCormick had his Chicago mansion built by the local architect
Adolph Cudell (1850-1910) and his partner Blumenthal in the form of a very corrupt
Second Empire <i>hôtel particulier</i>. It is good evidence of the rapidity with which taste
changed at this time that two years later he called on McKim, Mead &amp; White to build
for him in Richfield Springs, N.Y., one of the finest and most carefully composed of all
their Shingle Style houses. This house is notable not only for the subtly Japanese character
of the various sorts of veranda supports but even more for the way the composition
is unified under the broad front gable by the long horizontal line of the veranda roof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>repeating that of the stylobate-like stone wall of the terrace below. It is most unfortunate
that this house is now in a state of near-collapse.</p>

<p class='c010'>Little’s contemporary Shingleside House of 1881 in Swampscott, Mass., has been
mentioned already. Soberer than the Bell or the McCormick houses in its rectangular
shape and almost total lack of exterior detail, this had a galleried two-storey hall with a
window-wall as the principal living area. In the combining of different levels this house
recalled a little Cloverley Hall, but it was completely Americanized in scale and in
detail without being archaeologically Neo-Colonial.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the mid eighties J. Lyman Silsbee (1848-1913) had introduced the Shingle Style to
Chicago, and other Eastern architects were building good houses of this order in such
Western towns as Cheyenne, Idaho; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Pasadena,
California. In Philadelphia Wilson Eyre (1858-1944) developed the mode with a very
characteristic personal difference, often eschewing the use of shingles. If his exteriors
are rather English in their frequent use of brick and real half-timbering, his plans are
most original. The long rooms of varied and irregular shape are strung out on either
side of halls from which rise stairs within grilled enclosures of a sort that appeared in
England only in the houses of the nineties by Voysey and his contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c010'>The heyday of the Shingle Style was brief, even though it continued in use well down
into the nineties. The Colonial Revival implications, present from the first, soon encouraged
more and more comprehensive use of eighteenth-century detail, and this
supported the general tendency of the mid eighties in America away from the irregular
and towards more formal order (see Chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>). Something of this change could be
seen in Richardson’s latest houses in masonry such as the Glessner house of 1885-7 at
18th Street and South Prairie Avenue in Chicago, which still stands, and the contemporary
Mac Veagh house, long since destroyed, also in Chicago, both of which were
almost symmetrical as regards their front façades. The most drastic examples, of course,
of this Academic Reaction were such houses as McKim, Mead &amp; White’s Villard group
in New York (Plate <a href='#pl109b'>109<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) and their H. A. C. Taylor house in Newport with its formal
Anglo-Palladian plan of central hall and four corner rooms. Despite its even tighter
plan, however, their extant W. G. Low house in Bristol, R.I., of 1887—a year later
therefore than the demolished Taylor house—can properly be cited again as a masterpiece
of the Shingle Style (Plate <a href='#pl127'>127</a>). This illustrates very well how the loose massing
of the houses of the early eighties could be organized into a carefully balanced composition
without succumbing to any historical mode of design, whether Italian Renaissance
or American Colonial.</p>

<p class='c010'>Particularly interesting in this connexion are the small houses at Tuxedo Park, N.Y.,
which Price designed for Pierre Lorillard in 1885-6, some years before he began to build
Renaissance skyscrapers (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). Lorillard’s own house has a rather tight plan of
the Neo-Colonial sort; but the exterior with its paired chimneys on the front, a Richardsonian
entrance arch between them, and the verandas and terrace treated as voids carefully
related to the solid mass behind is still in the earlier tradition (Plate <a href='#pl125b'>125<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). In such
other houses by Price at Tuxedo as those for William Kent and Travis C. Van Buren,
the loose open plans of the immediately preceding years were organized into
<span class="sans">T</span> and <span class="sans">X</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>patterns, and the verandas and terraces were even more formally treated as important
elements in compositions made up of well-defined voids and solids (Figure <a href='#i270'>28</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>This brings us to the beginning of the career of Frank Lloyd Wright, already introduced
as an important coadjutor of Sullivan from 1887 to 1893. Although Wright’s
mature career begins only about 1900 (see Chapter <a href='#ch19'>19</a>), his apprentice years as a builder
of houses provide a very significant episode that is closely related to the earlier story
of the nineteenth-century house in England and America. By the late eighties a full-dress
Colonial Revival was under way in the East. But it was the particular combination
of freedom and order that had been achieved by Richardson in his latest houses, by
McKim, Mead &amp; White in their Low house, and by Price in his Tuxedo houses which
was the immediate tradition from which Wright’s domestic architecture grew far more
than the work of Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c010'>Born in 1867, Wright had had some two years in the Engineering School—there was
no architectural school—at the University of Wisconsin when he came to Chicago at
the age of twenty in 1887. He first found work in the office of Silsbee whom
Wright’s uncle Jenkin Lloyd Jones had brought to Chicago a year or two earlier to
design All Souls’ Unitarian Church, of which he was minister. The young architect’s first
work, nominally a Silsbee commission, was the Hillside Home School built in 1887 for
his aunts near Spring Green, Wisconsin. This was a rather provincial specimen of a
Shingle Style house and was later demolished by Wright himself.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Shifting over the following year to the Adler &amp; Sullivan office, Wright by 1889
was married and ready to build a house for himself on the strength of a five-year
contract with his new employers. This house, at 428 Forest Avenue in Oak Park, Ill.,
still extant but much pulled about, derives almost entirely from Price’s cottages at
Tuxedo except that the plan is much less formal. In the interior, the wide openings
between the rooms are not framed by architraves but seem to have been produced by
pulling back the walls beneath the continuous frieze. In this treatment, rather Japanese
in concept, Wright would seem to have been influenced by White’s handling of the hall
of the Newcomb house, even though that is rather Japanese also in some of the detailing
and Wright’s is not.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wright’s next important work is the James Charnley house at 1365 Astor Street in
Chicago, built in 1891-2. This was actually a commission of the Adler &amp; Sullivan firm,
but one of which he had entire charge. A city house built of tawny Roman brick like
that used for the court of the Boston Public Library, this is as formal<a id="r343"></a><a href='#f343' class='c025'><sup>[343]</sup></a> as anything
McKim, Mead &amp; White had yet designed. But there is no High Renaissance or Colonial
reminiscence whatever in the external detailing. The Charnley house is rather a conscientious
attempt to emulate in a modest three-storey residence the highly original
design of Sullivan’s newly completed Wainwright Building in Saint Louis.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wright was also accepting various private commissions on the side, mostly very small
ones, by this time. The George Blossom house of 1892 at 4858 Kenwood Avenue on
the south side of Chicago, however, is of more consequence. Externally, this follows
rather closely McKim, Mead &amp; White’s Taylor house in the curved Ionic entrance
porch and the recurrent Palladian windows, not to speak of the use of yellow-painted
clapboards and white-painted trim of simplified academic character. Even the plan is for
the most part symmetrically ordered. But behind the formal range of entrance lobby and
two small corner rooms at the front the whole centre of the house opens up as a single
great living-hall. In this living-hall a wide ingle-nook is lined up on axis with the entrance,
the elaborate staircase rises in several flights across one end, and wide openings
connect with the library and the dining room. The dining room, which ends in a curved
bay with a continuous window-band, is almost a copy of the original library of Richardson’s
Sherman house. In another Wright house of 1892, that for A. W. Harlan, also on
the south side of Chicago, at 4414 Greenwood Avenue, which Sullivan happened to see,
he recognized his assistant’s hand and this brought about the break between the two
before Wright’s contract ran out.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Wright set up for himself in 1893 there were two paths open to him. That he
actually considered following the path of Academic Reaction, so heavily publicized by
the success of the World’s Fair, is evident from his project of this year for a Library and
Museum in Milwaukee (see Chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>). But when Burnham at this point offered to
send Wright to Paris to study at the École des Beaux-Arts and then to the new American
Academy which he and McKim were planning to start in Rome, in preparation for
taking him on as designing partner, the young architect turned the opportunity down.</p>

<p class='c010'>The W. H. Winslow house of 1893 in Auvergne Place in River Forest, Ill., always
considered by Wright his ‘first’, shares many qualities with the Blossom and Harlan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>houses, but is altogether a much more mature and original work (Plate <a href='#pl128a'>128<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The
front is completely symmetrical and as formal as that of the Charnley house of two
years before.<a id="r344"></a><a href='#f344' class='c025'><sup>[344]</sup></a> Broad and low, of fine Roman brickwork with a rich band of moulded
terracotta the full depth of the upper-storey windows below the wide eaves, the general
effect of this has usually been considered very Sullivanian. But as Wright himself was
responsible for the Adler &amp; Sullivan work that this house most resembles—the Charnley
house, certainly; and the Victoria Hotel of 1892 at Chicago Heights, probably—it is more
accurate to consider that the Winslow house represents a continuation of his own manner
of the previous year or two. The plan is more axial and less open than that of the
Blossom house, the still rather Richardsonian dining room with its rounded bay being
placed here at the centre of the rear. The staircase, still so prominent in the Shingle Style
way at the Blossom house, is here pushed out of sight between walls.</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 29. Frank Lloyd Wright: Chicago, Isidore Heller house, 1897, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Wright’s next important house, that of 1897 for Isidore Heller at 5132 Woodlawn
Avenue on the south side of Chicago, perhaps shows some Japanese<a id="r345"></a><a href='#f345' class='c025'><sup>[345]</sup></a> influence in the
succession of eaves-lines, one above the other. It is the development of the plan, however,
that is most significant, as also the effect of the planning on the treatment of the
exterior (Figure <a href='#i272'>29</a>). The two principal living rooms are linked by a stair-hall into which
they both open through wide apertures—no more mere doorways than in his own house
of 1889, but tall breaks in the continuity of the walls. Although these rooms have ingle-nooks,
they are not casual and cosy in the Shingle Style way but carefully ordered;
both, indeed, are of regular cruciform shape. This shape, moreover, is given external
expression in the plastic articulation of the external massing, an articulation that the
multiple eaves echo above.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two years later, in the Joseph W. Husser house, now destroyed, in Buena Park on the
north side of Chicago, Wright’s personal development of domestic planning was carried
much farther (Figure <a href='#i273'>30</a>). Here the main living rooms were all raised to the first storey
in order to have a good view of Lake Michigan, and the interior space was continued
uninterrupted along the main axis of the house from the dining-room fireplace across
the landing and through to the living-room fireplace. But the dining room was also
articulated along a cross axis, extending outward into a large polygonal bay facing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>lake, somewhat like the more Richardsonian bays of the Blossom and Winslow dining
rooms.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Between the two houses just described, in which Wright’s planning developed so
rapidly and so boldly towards unified but articulated space, came the River Forest
Golf Club in River Forest, Ill. The front wing of this, built in 1898,<a id="r346"></a><a href='#f346' class='c025'><sup>[346]</sup></a> showed a comparable
maturing of his vocabulary of wooden construction. The two Chicago houses
were both of brick with rather lush Sullivanian terracotta decoration below the eaves
not unlike that on the Schiller Building. At the Golf Club the characteristic feeling of the
Shingle Style for rough natural wood surfaces was revived by Wright but made more
architectonic in scale. Below continuous window bands protected by his characteristic
hovering eaves, the lower walls and the terrace parapets were sheathed with boards
and battens, not applied vertically as by Downing, but horizontally. Uncovered terrace,
covered veranda, glazed foyer, all were closely related spatial areas, the last two
unified by the continuous roof. The only solid element was the broad stone chimney
marking the point where the main axis and the subsidiary axis of the low side-wings
crossed. In 1901 the building was much enlarged by Wright, but quite in the original
spirit (Plate <a href='#pl128b'>128<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1900, the last year of the nineteenth century, with which this account of Wright’s
beginnings may properly close, he built two houses side by side in Kankakee, Ill. He
also designed for the <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> ‘A Home in a Prairie Town’ which was published
in February 1901. The larger of the two Kankakee houses, that for B. Harley
Bradley at 701 South Harrison Avenue, is a large, loosely cruciform composition with
low-pitched gables projecting in blunt points well beyond the ends of the wings. The
smaller Hickox house, next door at 687 South Harrison Avenue, has a more advanced
plan under similar roofs. Wood stripping suggests the stud structure underneath the
stucco of the walls as do also, and rather more directly, the wooden window mullions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>(Plate <a href='#pl142a'>142<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The living room here, flanked by semi-octagonal music and dining rooms,
extends across the ‘garden front’ and opens by french doors on to the uncovered terrace
(Figure <a href='#i274'>31</a>). Here the articulated but unified space of the Husser house was reduced in
scale and simplified until it provided a quite new concept of domestic planning, later
to be widely influential internationally (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>). Towards that new concept
much of the development of the Anglo-American house since as far back as the 1790s
may seem—not too exaggeratedly—to have been tending.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> project for a ‘House in a Prairie Town’, from which the
term ‘Prairie Houses’ for Wright’s characteristic production of the next decade derives,
is larger than the Hickox house, but the living area was intended to be very similarly
unified and articulated. In one version Wright even proposed carrying this space up
two storeys in the centre, somewhat like one of Shaw’s manorial halls. As on the River
Forest Golf Club, the long lines of the low hip roofs shelter very long window-bands—out
of Shaw, via Richardson, presumably. Although the <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> house
was intended to be stuccoed like the Kankakee houses, the window mullions echo the
underlying wooden stud structure. As at the Golf Club, the chimneys would be the
only really solid elements, passing up through the crossing volumes defined by the two
levels of roof. The lower line of eaves extends, somewhat as on McKim, Mead &amp; White’s
McCormick house, over the <i>porte-cochère</i> on one side and over the veranda on the other,
a treatment Wright had already tried out somewhat clumsily on the Bradley house.</p>

<p class='c010'>In considering the significance of these Wright houses of 1900 it must be recognized
that even in America they were highly exceptional. Despite the fact that the ‘Prairie
house’ project was published in a general magazine of national circulation, its immediate
influence was very slight indeed. For all the vigour of the two great Chicago achievements
of the nineties, Sullivan’s skyscrapers and Wright’s earliest houses, the main
direction of American architecture in 1900 was quite different. So also in the England of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>these years, where Shaw’s house for Fred White and his Bryanston had introduced by
the nineties almost the same sort of Academic Revival as had McKim, Mead &amp; White’s
Villard and Taylor houses, the work of Voysey, the English architect most comparable
to Wright, was also almost as exceptional. The line of architectural development had
already split as sharply as in America, with the difference that the longer-lived Shaw
himself had taken the lead in the academic direction that Richardson’s pupils, McKim
and White, took in America.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although Charles Francis Annesley Voysey (1857-1941)<a id="r347"></a><a href='#f347' class='c025'><sup>[347]</sup></a> was ten years older than
Wright, it is understandable with English conditions that his architectural career got
under way little earlier. From 1874 to 1880 he worked as a pupil in the office of Seddon;
from 1880 until he set up for himself in 1882 he was assistant to Devey.<a id="r348"></a><a href='#f348' class='c025'><sup>[348]</sup></a> In 1883 Voysey
sold his first designs for wallpapers and printed fabrics, but for several more years he did
little building. His first house, The Cottage at Bishop’s Itchington in Warwickshire, was
built only in 1888; in the next two years various projects of his, increasingly original in
character, were published in the <i>British Architect</i>; of these the one for a house<a id="r349"></a><a href='#f349' class='c025'><sup>[349]</sup></a> at Dovercourt
of 1890 was the most advanced.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the late eighties Nesfield and Godwin were both dead and leadership in English
architecture, particularly as regards the domestic field, rested more firmly than ever in
Shaw’s hands. The forces of innovation in English art were concentrated in the decorative
field, thanks in part to Webb’s continuing activities with the Morris firm. But
there is some question how well younger men like Voysey really knew Webb’s architectural
work; almost none of it was published, and some of the best is hidden in remote
parts of Scotland and the North of England. The work of A. H. Mackmurdo (1851-1942)
was perhaps somewhat better known, but he was much more active with furniture,
chintzes, and wallpapers than with building in the eighties. A project for a ‘House
for an Artist’ that he published in his magazine <i>The Hobby Horse</i> in 1888 was of considerable
promise, however. In any case Voysey soon rivalled Mackmurdo as a designer
of furniture, wallpapers, and chintzes, and quite outclassed him as an architect. Mackmurdo’s
most significant influence was probably abroad (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The existence of an earlier project dated 1888 for Voysey’s house for J. W. Forster at
Bedford Park has led to some confusion. The executed house dates from 1891. Sometimes
known as the Grey House, it is very different indeed from its neighbours, by this
time some fifteen or more years old, by Godwin, Shaw, and their pupils. For one
thing, its walls are covered with roughcast, already used by Voysey on The Cottage at
Bishop’s Itchington; for another, it is a three-storey rectangular box, severe and rather
formal beneath its low hipped roof, not quaint and irregular like even the simplest of
the earlier houses. The casement windows are arranged in bands between stone mullions,
regularly but not symmetrically, and the eaves troughs are supported by delicately
curved iron brackets. Otherwise there is no external detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>The plan of the Forster house is also compact and regular, with entrance on the left
side and living room across the front. In other words this house represents as much of a
reaction against the picturesqueness of the earlier Queen Anne as does Shaw’s Fred
White house, yet is quite without eighteenth-century reminiscence.<a id="r350"></a><a href='#f350' class='c025'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>More interesting and more prominent than the contemporary storey-and-a-half house
known as The Studio at 17 St Dunstan’s Road in West Kensington are a pair of terrace-houses,
also designed in 1891 but begun only the next year, at 14-16 Hans Road off the
Brompton Road in London. Here Voysey dropped the roughcast he had originally proposed
and used Webb-like red brickwork with the windows characteristically arranged
in bands between plain stone mullions. The elegantly original detailing of the projecting
stone porches and the curved line of the parapets at the top are related to his contemporary
decorative work and in notable contrast to the almost ‘Monumental Queen
Anne’ treatment of Mackmurdo’s slightly later house next door at No. 12.</p>

<p class='c010'>A moderate-sized country house, Perrycroft, Colwall, near Malvern, begun in 1893,
may be considered Voysey’s first mature production, introducing in executed work the
personal mode of design for which the Ward project of 1890 had already shown the
way, and from which he never moved very far in later years. This is comparable, not
to Wright’s ‘first’ house in River Forest of the same date, but to his more advanced
work of the end of the decade, the River Forest Golf Club and the Hickox house.
Roughcast walls, windows arranged in bands between plain mullions,<a id="r351"></a><a href='#f351' class='c025'><sup>[351]</sup></a> a regular composition
approaching but not quite reaching symmetry, these all follow from the Grey
House and the Studio. But, being in the country, the house could spread out more.
Moreover, the roofs were raised to a medieval pitch—45 degrees—so that their
conspicuously heavy slating is as much a part of Voysey’s simple craftsman-like mode as
are the off-white roughcast walls. The planning is closer to Webb’s than to Wright’s,
the rooms being less symmetrically shaped and not opening at all into one another in
the way of the Ward project.</p>

<p class='c010'>A rather larger house, begun in 1896 on the Hog’s Back near Guildford
in Surrey for the American Julian Sturgis, presumptive original of
Santayana’s <i>Last Puritan</i>, has a somewhat less balanced
composition with a prominent cross gable near one end (Plate <a href='#pl129a'>129<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
The characteristic stone-mullioned lights of several
of the rooms are here so extensive in their grouping as to constitute
window-walls of the earlier Shavian sort.</p>

<p class='c010'>In what is doubtless Voysey’s finest work, Broadleys on Lake Windermere, designed
in 1898, the roofs are lower once more, and the window-walls are concentrated in three
rounded bays along the lakeside terrace (Plate <a href='#pl129b'>129<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Here the hall in the middle is carried
up two storeys, quite as Wright proposed to do in one version of his first <i>Ladies
Home Journal</i> house (Figure <a href='#i277'>32</a>). In its horizontality, its concentration of fenestration,
and its avoidance of medieval feeling, this house represents the extreme point of innovation
and originality in Voysey’s work.</p>

<p class='c010'>His own house, The Orchard, at Chorley Wood in Hertfordshire, was completed in
1900. Externally this resembles closely his earlier houses, but The Orchard has two cross
gables and hence a stronger feeling of symmetry. Towards this the more regular and
carefully balanced spacing of the window bands further conduces. In studying the vocabulary
of this house, a vocabulary destined to be parodied <i>ad infinitum</i> by architects and
then by builders in the next twenty-five years, one can understand his feeling that he
was a reformer not an innovator—the last disciple of Pugin, so to say, to whose secular work
a line can be traced back via Webb, Street, and Butterfield. In Voysey’s special sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>continuity, which grew on him in later years, lies his great difference from Wright; for
Wright was certainly determined, from the time he designed the Winslow house, to be
as great an innovator—as much of an architectural creator—as was Sullivan in his skyscrapers.
None the less, to look forward a little, such a house by Voysey as that now
called Little Court at Pyrford Common in Surrey, built in 1902, is quite worthy of
comparison with Wright’s masterpieces of that year (see Chapter <a href='#ch19'>19</a>). It shows little
further development beyond his houses of the late nineties, however, except for a
certain increase in horizontal emphasis.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just before and just after 1900, Voysey’s work was very much better known and more
influential in England, and increasingly in other countries,<a id="r352"></a><a href='#f352' class='c025'><sup>[352]</sup></a> than was Wright’s either at
home or abroad at that time. Moreover, many contemporaries in England were building
rather similar houses. One of them, M. H. Baillie Scott (1865-1945), who also
worked a good deal on the Continent, developed his planning much farther in the
direction of Wright-like openness along the lines suggested by Voysey’s project of
1890 for the Ward house. The many houses, both executed and projected, that
Baillie Scott published in <i>Houses and Gardens</i> in 1906 made his planning known to the
young architects of the Continent (Figure <a href='#i278'>33</a>). Characteristic is his Blackwell house on
Lake Windermere of about 1900 with an enormous two-storey living-hall elaborated
spatially by various ingle-nooks and so forth. The plan was published by Muthesius in
1904, and may well have influenced Adolf Loos in Vienna and other Europeans even
before his own book appeared (see Chapters <a href='#ch20'>20</a> and <a href='#ch21'>21</a>). After 1906 Baillie Scott’s work
became quite ‘traditional’, and it is hard to believe that the projects published in the
later version of his <i>Houses and Gardens</i> in 1933 are by the same man.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The name of W. R. Lethaby (1857-1931), later the biographer of Webb and an influential
writer on architecture, should also be at least mentioned here. When Lethaby
left Shaw’s office, where he had been chief assistant, he began his career by building
Avon Tyrrell in Hampshire in 1891, a large brick country house closer to Webb’s than
to Shaw’s in character. But his main contribution was not in the field of domestic
architecture.<a id="r353"></a><a href='#f353' class='c025'><sup>[353]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Already by the mid nineties, the most successful English house-builder, more than
rivalling Voysey in the quantity and occasionally even in the quality of his domestic
work, was Sir Edwin L. Lutyens (1869-1944). Beginning like Voysey in the late
eighties by building cottages, his first house of real distinction was the one he built for
his cousin and frequent collaborator, the garden-designer Gertrude Jekyll, at Munstead
Wood near Godalming in 1896. Several other good houses followed shortly, including
notably The Orchards, Godalming, in 1898; but this early period of his work really
culminates in Deanery Gardens at Sonning in Berkshire of 1901 (Plate <a href='#pl182b'>182<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). In these
houses are preserved all the best of the Shavian Manorial—the great timber-framed
bay-window of the two-storeyed hall at Deanery Gardens is exemplary—simplifying
and regularizing that mode under the influence of Webb and even approaching Webb’s
standards of craftsmanship in the execution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Like Webb in his later work, Lutyens used almost from the first a good deal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>stylistic detail in interiors; he also turned back towards the ‘traditional’ in his exteriors
considerably earlier than Baillie Scott when designing such houses as Overstrand Hall in
Norfolk and Tigbourne Court at Witley in Surrey, both built in 1899 two years before
Deanery Gardens. Lutyens became from about 1906 the leading architect of his generation
in England, and his later work will be treated elsewhere (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>). His increasing
material success after the opening years of the century, rivalling Shaw’s in
the previous generation, is to a certain extent the measure, though not the cause, of
Voysey’s decline in popularity.</p>

<p class='c010'>C. R. Ashbee (1863-1942) and George Walton (1867-1933)<a id="r354"></a><a href='#f354' class='c025'><sup>[354]</sup></a> were other domestic
architects active in the nineties and the early years of the new century. The latter belongs
to the Glasgow School, of which Mackintosh was the principal figure, and like Mackintosh
he was more decorator than architect (see Chapter <a href='#ch17'>17</a>). One house in England, The
Leys at Elstree of 1901, may be mentioned here. The interiors are fine examples of the
Arts and Crafts mode, as it is sometimes called, more stylized than Voysey’s but less
original than Mackintosh’s. The plan is organized symmetrically around a large two-storey
hall rivalling Baillie Scott’s of the period in its complex spatial development.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ashbee was one of the first Europeans to appreciate the significance of Wright, and
was appropriately chosen by Wasmuth to write the introduction to his second publication
of Wright’s work in 1911 (see Chapter <a href='#ch19'>19</a>). Three houses by Ashbee side by side
in Cheyne Walk in London, No. 37 of 1894 and Nos 38-39 of 1904, represent the
chronological span of his significant architectural production and illustrate clearly his
characteristic progress from the Shavian to an originality at least comparable to Voysey’s.
Closely associated with the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, Ashbee was like most of
these men except Voysey<a id="r355"></a><a href='#f355' class='c025'><sup>[355]</sup></a> and Lutyens generally more active in the field of decorative
art than in building. Right through this period English decorative art exercised a major
influence on the Continent (see Chapters <a href='#ch16'>16</a> and <a href='#ch17'>17</a>). So close is Mackintosh’s tie with
the Continent that his schools and even his houses are better discussed in relation to the
Art Nouveau.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of all these English architects who have just been mentioned, Voysey was the most
creative in the field of domestic architecture and, except for Lutyens, the most productive
down at least through the early years of the twentieth century; after 1910 he built
almost nothing at all. Yet Voysey did not die until 1941, by which time a younger
generation, to his confusion, had accepted him as a father of a modern architecture that
he disapproved as strongly as did Lutyens. In 1940 he returned almost from the grave to
receive the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the Picturesque cottages of the opening decades of the nineteenth century to
the early masterpieces of Wright and Voysey around 1900 is a far cry, further perhaps
in the drastic revision that it represented of so old-established a building type as the
dwelling-house than from Parris’s Market Street buildings in Boston of 1824 to Sullivan’s
Carson, Pirie &amp; Scott Store in Chicago as completed eighty years later in 1904.
Yet in Anglo-American domestic architecture, quite as was the case with commercial
architecture, real achievement recurred all through the century.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> two preceding chapters, in entering the nineties, crossed what is perhaps the major
historical frontier within the century and a half covered by this book. The skyscrapers
of Sullivan and the early houses of Wright and Voysey—despite Voysey’s own disavowal
of modernism—are among the first major manifestations of the period of architectural
history that extends down to and includes our own time. The contemporaries
of these men who were the new leaders on the Continent in the nineties had as sharp a
sense of the novelty of the innovations they were making as did Sullivan or Wright, and
the most characteristic stylistic formulation of this decade in Europe was appropriately
known from an early date<a id="r356"></a><a href='#f356' class='c025'><sup>[356]</sup></a> as ‘Art Nouveau’. Before discussing the Art Nouveau itself,
two related developments that precede it must be considered at least briefly. In France,
various feats of metal construction of the sixties, seventies, and eighties had prepared
the way for the Art Nouveau on the technical side, and these have, moreover, considerable
intrinsic interest in their own right. English innovations in decorative art of the
eighties and nineties are accepted by most historians as providing one of the most important
immediate sources of the Art Nouveau,<a id="r357"></a><a href='#f357' class='c025'><sup>[357]</sup></a> and English architecture and architectural
theory of the later decades of the nineteenth century certainly offered a generic
stimulus to Europeans between 1890 and 1910 that was of vital consequence to subsequent
developments.</p>
<p class='c010'>By the early nineties advanced English work began to be widely known on the Continent.
In 1888 the German architect Alexander Koch (1848-1911) started to publish
annually his <i>Academy Architecture</i> bringing current English production, and many significant
projects also, to the attention of designers abroad. <i>L’Architecture moderne en
Angleterre</i> by the French architect Paul Sédille (1836-1900) appeared in Paris in 1890.
The architect Hermann Muthesius (1861-1927), who was stationed at the German
Embassy in London from 1896 to 1903 primarily to study low-cost housing, issued two
folio volumes devoted to <i>Die englische Baukunst der Gegenwart</i> in 1900-2, another on
<i>Die neuere kirchliche Baukunst in England</i> in 1902 and, in 1904-5, three thick quarto volumes
on <i>Das englische Haus</i>. These richly illustrated books made much of the story of the development
of English architecture in the second half of the century available in German
long before it was pieced together by the English (see Chapters <a href='#ch12'>12</a> and <a href='#ch15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Voysey never worked abroad; but his houses, known internationally from an early
date thanks to their publication in the <i>Studio</i>, an English periodical founded in 1893,
were soon much studied on the Continent, and to a lesser extent in America. Voysey’s
contemporaries Baillie Scott and Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868-1928), however,
both received foreign commissions as early as 1898; in fact, Mackintosh and his highly
original ideas—he was no Voyseyan ‘reformer’ but a very bold innovator—received
more support abroad than at home and were much more influential on the Continent
than in Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Historians of modern architecture have generally emphasized, and rightly, the special
importance of the advances in metal construction<a id="r358"></a><a href='#f358' class='c025'><sup>[358]</sup></a> that were made in France in the
later decades of the nineteenth century. The great name of the period is not that of
an architect but of an engineer, Gustave Eiffel (1832-1923). At the International Exhibition
of 1855 in Paris and again at the World’s Fair of 1893 in Chicago the vast metal-and-glass
structures were masked externally by real or imitated masonry façades. Between
these dates, however, came a series of French exhibition buildings that were increasingly
bold in scale and frank in design; with the construction of most of them Eiffel
was directly concerned. Yet his bridge over the Douro at Oporto in Portugal of 1876-7
quite overshadowed the Galerie des Machines that he and Krantz built for the Paris
Exhibition of 1867, as his later Pont de Garabit of 1880-4 outclassed the pavilion that
he designed for the Exhibition of 1878 and that portion of the Bon Marché Department
Store on which he collaborated in 1876 with the younger Boileau. In the exhibition buildings
the metalwork was completely exposed and in that of 1878<a id="r359"></a><a href='#f359' class='c025'><sup>[359]</sup></a> a serious attempt was
made to develop appropriate embellishments, quite as Wyatt had done for Brunel at
Paddington Station in London twenty-five years earlier. The rather tawdry result helps
to explain why innovations in architectural design had so little public support in France
in this period—a period, of course, when the bold innovations of the Impressionists
were revolutionizing another art in Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beside Eiffel’s gallery, the Anglo-Japanese room<a id="r360"></a><a href='#f360' class='c025'><sup>[360]</sup></a> which Whistler and Godwin showed
at this same exhibition must have seemed infinitely sophisticated, and even the Late
Stuart detailing of the cement-brick front of Shaw’s Jury House most agreeably urbane.
Such things might well have turned the attention of foreign architects towards England
earlier than was generally the case. Sédille, one of the less tradition-bound French professionals
of this period, did visit England in the eighties, publishing his book on current
English architecture, which has just been mentioned, ten years before Muthesius’s. His
selections, however, were not very discriminating, nor is there evidence that he profited
much from what he saw. The Printemps department store of 1881-9, designed of course
well before his trip, certainly shows no English influence.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the Paris Exhibition of 1889<a id="r361"></a><a href='#f361' class='c025'><sup>[361]</sup></a> Eiffel early proposed and, in
1887, was commissioned to build the tremendous all-metal tower<a id="r362"></a><a href='#f362' class='c025'><sup>[362]</sup></a>
which still dominates Paris (Plate <a href='#pl130a'>130A</a>). As has been noted, this
984-foot edifice was, down to the erection of the Empire State
Building in New York by Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon more than forty years
later, the tallest structure in the world. The Eiffel Tower, which
appropriately carries its designer’s name, is no more a building in
the ordinary sense than are his great bridges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>however. Although scraping so much higher skies than did Holabird &amp; Roche’s Tacoma
Building in Chicago, which was erected in precisely the same years, the Paris tower was
far less significant either technically or functionally. Except the painter Seurat, most contemporaries
disliked it, considering it a monstrous blemish on the Parisian skyline; today
of course, it is rightly deemed a nineteenth-century masterpiece, but a masterpiece of
engineering rather than of architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>As with Eiffel’s pavilion at the Exhibition of 1878, there is considerable ambiguity in
the design of the Eiffel Tower. Seen from a distance its four legs have much of the
vigorous spring of his bridges and the tapered shaft of criss-crossed metalwork seems—but
in fact is not—an almost inevitable expression of large-scale construction in metal.
Seen from nearer to, however, the arbitrarily arched forms that link the legs are very
conspicuous and also the coarse ornamentation of curvilinear strapwork—recalling a
little Wyatt’s at Paddington Station of nearly forty years before, but much less just in
scale—with which the basic forms are bedecked. The close similarity of this mixture of
frank construction and applied decoration to the Art Nouveau approach to the design
of metal structures will shortly become evident. Over-impressed, perhaps, by the more
functional engineering feat of construction at the 1889 Exhibition provided by the
wide-spanned metal-and-glass Palais des Machines of the engineers Contamin (1840-93),
Pierron, and Charton—in which the contribution of the associated architect C.-L.-F.
Dutert (1845-1906) was relatively unimportant—certain later critics have preferred
that structure to the Eiffel Tower. Yet it is the tower which clearly has more of the
magnificence of Eiffel’s bridges despite its irrelevant and (from a distance) almost invisible
ornamentation. The tower, moreover, is premonitory of the Art Nouveau; the
Galerie des Machines rather of later modern architecture (see Chapters <a href='#ch20'>20</a> and <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>One other line of innovation in France in these decades deserves mention. In 1871
Jules Saulnier built a factory for Chocolat Menier near Paris at Noisiel, S.-et-M., with an
exposed metal skeleton. The iron frame consists of diagonally set members rather similar
to the late medieval timber-framing of France, and the infilling of the panels is of
varicoloured bricks and tiles. This structure attracted the attention of Viollet-le-Duc,
who saw in it a realization of certain of his theoretical ambitions for nineteenth-century
architecture. He not only mentioned it very favourably in the second volume of his
<i>Entretiens</i>, which appeared in 1872, but in several illustrations suggested similar and
variant combinations of iron and masonry. In a colour plate, for example, he showed a
striking urban façade with its visible iron framework filled with brilliantly coloured
glazed tiles. By the nineties quite a few buildings in France had exploited very successfully
this structural system;<a id="r363"></a><a href='#f363' class='c025'><sup>[363]</sup></a> it is perhaps more important, however, that Viollet-le-Duc’s
text and illustrations made the idea familiar internationally.</p>

<p class='c010'>When one learns that Horta or Gaudí or various Americans ‘read Viollet-le-Duc’ in
the seventies and eighties one must assume that the <i>Entretiens</i>, of which the first volume
appeared in 1863, is meant—and perhaps even more specifically the second volume of
1872 with its accompanying set of plates. These last could be ‘read’ by architects to particularly
good purpose. The <i>Entretiens</i> were available to most Europeans in the original
language and to the English and the Americans in translation.<a id="r364"></a><a href='#f364' class='c025'><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>The characteristic employment of metal by Art Nouveau architects in the nineties and
the first decade of this century undoubtedly owed a great deal both to the inspiration of
Eiffel’s large engineering structures, culminating in his tower of 1887-9, and to the vigorous
critical support of Saulnier’s ideas which Viollet-le-Duc provided, not to speak of
the projects of his own that he published in 1872. The knot is tied tighter—although with
a different sort of structural development—when one notes that de Baudot, of all French
architects most particularly the disciple and heir of Viollet-le-Duc as well as a former
pupil of Henri Labrouste, was the first to exploit ferro-concrete architecturally and not
merely technically (see Chapter <a href='#ch18'>18</a>). Moreover, he employed as his contractor to construct
his epoch-making concrete church of St Jean de Montmartre in Paris of the
nineties (see Chapter <a href='#ch17'>17</a>), Contamin, one of the engineers responsible for the Galerie des
Machines at the Exhibition of 1889. But the European Art Nouveau was even less a
matter of structural innovation, pure and simple, than Sullivan’s contemporary skyscrapers
in America (see Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>This brief and curious episode in the history of art,<a id="r365"></a><a href='#f365' class='c025'><sup>[365]</sup></a> starting in the early nineties and
subsiding little more than a decade later, has always been called in English by a French
name, perhaps because it never became acclimatized in England but was always considered
a dubious import from Belgium and France. Despite the diffidence of the English—which
Americans fully shared—the Art Nouveau was an international mode. It was
as frequently called in France by the English name ‘Modern Style’, while to the Germans
it was ‘Jugendstil’ and to the Italians ‘stile Liberty’. The German term comes
from the magazine <i>Jugend</i>, whose illustrations and typography were fairly consistently
in the new mode; the Italian from Liberty’s, the shop in London whose orientalizing
fabrics became widely popular at this time (but with overtones from the obvious pun
involved). In Italian it is also, and much more descriptively, the ‘stile floreale’.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Art Nouveau is not primarily an architectural mode. Many of the finest and
boldest of the large edifices built between 1890 and 1910, however, beginning with
Sullivan’s skyscrapers, are certainly related to its ethos; and the Art Nouveau leaders
produced quite a few buildings of real distinction that can be defined by no other term.
Like the Rococo of the early and mid eighteenth century—which the Art Nouveau
sometimes closely resembled and to whose revived forms it was often vulgarly assimilated—it
was most successful as a mode of interior decoration. Generally linear rather
than plastic,<a id="r366"></a><a href='#f366' class='c025'><sup>[366]</sup></a> the Art Nouveau was also very closely associated with the graphic arts;
indeed they provide many of the most characteristic examples, as well as the earliest
items that can be considered possible prototypes.</p>

<p class='c010'>How far back the ultimate sources of the Art Nouveau should be sought, and precisely
where, continues to be a subject of active research. In the graphic arts there are certainly
significant similarities to be noted in William Blake’s<a id="r367"></a><a href='#f367' class='c025'><sup>[367]</sup></a> way of designing book
pages. Through the Pre-Raphaelites, moreover, a line of descent from Blake can be
traced down to the eighties and nineties when, indeed, his characteristic pages were
sometimes reproduced in facsimile. But oriental,<a id="r368"></a><a href='#f368' class='c025'><sup>[368]</sup></a> specifically Japanese, influence certainly
played some part also in the gestation of the mode. There is early evidence of that
influence on western architecture in the decorative work of Godwin and Nesfield in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>England, beginning already in the sixties, as also in the painting of the Impressionists in
France (see Chapters <a href='#ch10'>10</a> and <a href='#ch12'>12</a>). But the earliest designs that can be readily mistaken
for Continental work of 1900 are certainly by the English architect-decorator Mackmurdo
and date from just after 1880. Many of the textile and wallpaper patterns that
Mackmurdo, Heywood Sumner (1853-1940), and others created for the Century Guild,
founded in 1882, already have the characteristic semi-naturalistic<a id="r369"></a><a href='#f369' class='c025'><sup>[369]</sup></a> forms, swaying lines,
and asymmetrical organization of the mature decorative mode of the nineties. Even
more striking is the design of Mackmurdo’s title-page of 1883 for his book on the London
churches of Sir Christopher Wren<a id="r370"></a><a href='#f370' class='c025'><sup>[370]</sup></a>—a curious conjunction, this, of two opposed
stylistic developments of the eighties, the one towards the Baroque and the ‘Monumental
Queen Anne’, the other towards a wholly novel mode of ornamentation.</p>

<p class='c010'>English products, such as were shown by the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society from
its foundation in 1888, soon reached the Continent. Moreover, even before the <i>Studio</i>
began publication in 1893 Koch’s <i>Academy Architecture</i> (from 1888), which has already
been mentioned, and (from 1890) his review <i>Innendekoration</i>, as well as less specialized
English magazines such as (from 1884) Mackmurdo’s <i>Hobby Horse</i> and (from 1891) <i>The
Yellow Book</i>, with its highly stylized and very curvilinear illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley,
were eagerly studied all over western Europe. The younger men were reading William
Morris, too, and responding enthusiastically to his ethical and social demands for a
reform of the household arts. At the same time the novel styles of the most advanced
Post-Impressionist painters offered a powerful stimulus to architects.</p>

<p class='c010'>This matter of the relationship between advanced painting and advanced architecture
in the nineteenth century, a relationship destined to be of rather greater importance in
the early twentieth, deserves some broader comment and recapitulation here. A hundred
and fifty years before, when Romantic Classicism was being born in Rome,
painters, sculptors, and architects shared common ideals and worked with a full understanding
of each other’s problems (see Chapter <a href='#ch01'>1</a>). The backgrounds of David’s bas-relief-like
early paintings show architecture in the most advanced taste of the day, and
no more beautiful Romantic Classical furniture was actually produced than that which
he invented for his Classical scenes and occasionally introduced in his modern portraits.
The Classical sculptor Thorwaldsen at the Glyptothek in Munich and later at the Thorwaldsen
Museum in Copenhagen collaborated closely with the architects Klenze and
Bindesbøll. Schinkel was himself a Romantic painter of some distinction before he
matured as a Romantic Classical architect, and he collaborated later on the mural for
the front of the Altes Museum with the painter Peter Cornelius, as did Klenze on the
decorations of the Glyptothek in Munich.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the gradual decline of Romantic Classicism architects and painters had more
difficulty in developing parallel programmes; and the results of collaboration between
them in the decoration of buildings were rarely as happy as the backgrounds the architects
sometimes supplied to the painters. Ingres’s stained-glass windows of the forties in
the Chapelle d’Orléans at Dreux and the Chapelle Saint-Ferdinand at Neuilly have been
mentioned. More successful are the murals by Delacroix in Joly’s library at the Chambre
des Deputés in Paris; but there is hardly that real visual harmony between picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>and setting that the previous period had often achieved. However, the rising interest in
architectural polychromy and the extension of the range of acceptable stylistic models
to include the Early Renaissance and even the Middle Ages were both encouraged
by the turn that the art of painting was beginning to take on the Continent around
1815. Hübsch, for example, was a sort of Nazarener among architects. Later Ingres was
a close friend of Hittorff, even though he never collaborated with him to any good purpose
(see Chapter <a href='#ch03'>3</a>), much less with Viollet-le-Duc, with whom he was also on good
terms. The degree of stylization that Early Christian, Romanesque, or Gothic architectural
modes properly demanded was not yet acceptable in figural art. Indeed, the
rather <i>quattrocento</i> early pictures of Ingres were much too ‘Gothic’ for most of his contemporaries
and are generally less esteemed than his more Classical work even today.</p>

<p class='c010'>Above all, the ever-rising importance of landscape in the painting of all countries was
necessarily without real parallels in architecture, except in so far as the increasing desire
to open up houses towards the circumambient view reflects a similar preoccupation with
the natural scene. As to Realism, the principal artistic movement of the mid century in
French art, that could only be echoed in architectural theory. Impressionism may seem
even more difficult to relate to architecture.<a id="r371"></a><a href='#f371' class='c025'><sup>[371]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In England in the fifties, however, a loose alliance did exist between the new Pre-Raphaelite
painters and some of the leading High Victorian Gothic architects, both
supported for a time by the critic Ruskin. In the sixties and seventies Morris on the one
hand, developing as a decorator out of the Pre-Raphaelite <i>milieu</i> of Rossetti and Ford
Madox Brown, and Whistler on the other hand, chiefly nurtured in the advanced
artistic world of Paris but also influenced in England by Rossetti, collaborated closely
with architects—Morris with Webb and with Bodley, Whistler with Godwin. As has
been noted, the strikingly novel results of the latter collaboration were displayed in
Paris in their Anglo-Japanese room at the Exhibition of 1878. Europeans became generally
aware of Morris’s decorative work only somewhat later.</p>

<p class='c010'>In France in these decades fewer painters than in England commissioned talented individualists
of the order of Shaw or Webb or Godwin to build their houses.<a id="r372"></a><a href='#f372' class='c025'><sup>[372]</sup></a> If they
were Realists or Impressionists they could not have afforded to do so; if they were prosperous
Academicians they would not have wished to. Even in England, Millais, after he
became really successful, preferred to build a dull house in South Kensington of quite
conventional character rather than to employ Shaw or Webb or Godwin.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the eighties the most advanced European painters, not merely those of France but
more generally, turned away from Realism and even from Impressionism in order to
concern themselves more with pattern or with expression. The two French leaders of
this reaction whose art seems to posterity most architectonic, Cézanne and Seurat, did
not affect architecture or design at this time at all. Even Van Gogh and Gauguin, whose
styles have a more decorative inflection, were less influential than such almost forgotten
painters as the Dutch Toorop and the Belgian Khnopff, the better-known Belgian Ensor,
or the Swiss Hodler and the Norwegian Munch, not to speak of the English Beardsley.</p>

<p class='c010'>The general admiration in <i>avant-garde</i> circles for the work of these artists—with which
went paradoxically a continuing and even growing estimation of the anti-architectonic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>pictures of the Impressionists and Neo-Impressionists both French and native—ran
parallel everywhere with the rapid rise and spread of the Art Nouveau. In some sense,
indeed, the Art Nouveau may be considered the equivalent as a mode of design of what
is somewhat ambiguously called Impressionism in music—the work of Debussy, Delius,
etc. Some of the chief critical supporters of the new painters in the nineties such as Julius
Meier-Graefe were also active proponents of the Art Nouveau. Yet advanced painting,
in fact, provided little more than a sympathetic atmosphere for the birth of the Art Nouveau,
somewhat as the young painters and critics of the third quarter of the eighteenth
century had done in Rome for the gestation of Romantic Classicism in architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why the Art Nouveau should have been initiated full-fledged by Victor Horta
(1861-1947)<a id="r373"></a><a href='#f373' class='c025'><sup>[373]</sup></a> in Brussels in 1892 remains a mystery. The rather similar stylistic crystallization
in Sullivan’s architectural ornament, henceforth almost equally organic and
sinuous in character, had begun several years earlier even before the interiors of the
Auditorium were designed in 1887-8. These will hardly have been known in Belgium,
for few foreigners were aware of Sullivan’s work at all until they came to Chicago
to visit the World’s Fair in 1893. Illustrations of the remarkable ironwork on Gaudí’s
Palau Güell in Barcelona are not likely to have reached Brussels either, though
several of its interiors were published in <i>The Decorator and Furnisher</i> in New York in
1892. In any case Gaudí’s ultimate style was only beginning to take form in the early
nineties. A certain amount of quite original decoration was being done in New York
from the beginning of the eighties by Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933), but it is unlikely
that it was known abroad. Tiffany’s ‘Favrile’ glass came a good deal later and is
precisely contemporaneous with the Art Nouveau,<a id="r374"></a><a href='#f374' class='c025'><sup>[374]</sup></a> of which it continued to be for a
decade and more one of the most internationally distinguished products.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is generally assumed that Horta knew the rather similar glass designed earlier by
Émile Gallé (1846-1904) in France and that he already had some familiarity with the
work of such painters as Ensor, Khnopff, and Toorop, if not with that of Hodler,
Munch, or Beardsley. Yet such familiarity would hardly by itself have counter-balanced
the academic training he received from his master and later employer Balat (see
Chapter 9). This explains, however, the very Classical character of his Temple des Passions
Humaines, erected in 1884 in the Parc du Cinquantenaire in Brussels. Horta did
no building on his own between 1885 and 1892. Presumably, however, it was knowledge
of the theories and the projects of Viollet-le-Duc acquired in those years that
encouraged him to make frank and expressive use of iron in association with masonry
when he really began to practise. Yet the influence of Viollet-le-Duc hardly
provides an explanation for the specific character of his innovations in ornament or the
consistency of style that he achieved almost at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>Against such rather negative assumptions, a more positive one may be set. In the
Tassel house in Brussels, completed in 1893, Horta’s first mature work, he introduced an
English<a id="r375"></a><a href='#f375' class='c025'><sup>[375]</sup></a> wallpaper between the exposed metal structural elements of the dining-room
walls. It is highly likely, therefore, that the new English decorative products were
already known to him the previous year<a id="r376"></a><a href='#f376' class='c025'><sup>[376]</sup></a> when he designed and began this epoch-making
house.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>The Tassel house at 6 Rue Paul-Émile Janson, just off the Avenue Louise, initiated a
new architectural mode as definitely as one modest terrace-house could possibly do.
How long before 1892, when the Tassel house was begun, Horta may have been designing
on paper in this way does not seem to be known. When one considers how important
the innumerable projects of the second half of the eighteenth century are to our
understanding of the architectural revolution that established Romantic Classicism as
the successor to the Baroque, the absence of such clues concerning the gestation of the
Art Nouveau is most exasperating; but considerable research by students of the period
has so far brought little that seems relevant to light.</p>

<p class='c010'>In plan there are no very great novelties in the Tassel house, although the interior partitions
of the principal floor are bent to give varying shapes and sizes to symmetrically
disposed spaces that open rather freely into one another. The major innovation lay in
the frank expression of metal structure and in the characteristic decoration, particularly
that of the stair-hall (Plate <a href='#pl130b'>130<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). There at the foot of the stair an iron column rises free
and svelte out of which iron bands branch at the top, like vines from the trunk of a
sapling, to form brackets under the curved openwork beams of iron above. Other
lighter and less structural bands interlace to form the stair-rail. The organic, swaying,
and interweaving lines of the metalwork, both structural and decorative, were originally
rather boldly echoed in purely ornamental curvilinear decoration painted on the walls,
and they are still so echoed in the patterns of the extant floor mosaic.</p>

<p class='c010'>These patterns in the stair-hall are each unique, not repeated like those on the English
chintzes and wallpapers they so much resemble. The lines, whether moving freely
in space like those of the ironwork, painted on the curved wall, or inlaid in the flat floor
plane, all form part of complex organic motifs. The result is therefore more comparable
to Mackmurdo’s title-page of 1883, or even to some of the repoussé brasswork on his
furniture. (Like the very few buildings Mackmurdo designed, this furniture is quite
rectilinear otherwise, it might be noted.) During the brief life of the Art Nouveau hardly
even Horta himself, much less those who followed in his footsteps, achieved an ensemble
more exemplary than this stair-hall. It is truly a work of interior architecture, not
merely a matter of applied decoration as is most of the ornament used in association
with the English wallpaper in the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The façade of the house is much less striking than the interiors. However, the linear
curves of the internal structural elements are reflected plastically, so to say, in the bowing
forward of the entire central window area. This is so extensive as to approach, but not to
equal, English window-walls of the preceding decades. In the upper storeys the lights in
this broad bay-window are subdivided only by iron colonnette-mullions and topped
with exposed iron beams. There is no archaeological reminiscence of any past style here;
yet it must have been from local stucco-work of the Rococo period that Horta drew the
inspiration for his carved stone detail. It certainly does not derive either from England or
from Viollet-le-Duc. Horta was, and continued to be, much less happy in devising such
plastic ornament than in his metalwork; but he felt obliged to apply it here and there on
capitals, cornices, brackets, and so forth, just as conventional architects of the time used
the common coin of the Renaissance or Gothic vocabularies.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>The Tassel façade may be almost unnoticeable today unless one looks carefully for its
exposed metalwork and its rather original detailing, but it evidently had an almost instant
appeal in the Brussels of the nineties. The somewhat similar Frison house at 37 Rue
Lebeau was built in 1893-4, and in 1895 three more houses were begun, of which the
finest is the much larger Hôtel Solvay at 224 Avenue Louise.<a id="r377"></a><a href='#f377' class='c025'><sup>[377]</sup></a> This house was built, together
with a laboratory started a year later, over a period of several years for the famous
chemist Ernest Solvay. It remains the most complete of Horta’s domestic commissions,
since it retains all the original furniture designed by the architect, though now a <i>maison
de couture</i>. The broad façade is much more plastic than that of the Tassel house with
the walls curving forward in the first and second storeys to enframe two tall flanking
bays subdivided by metal colonnettes and transoms (Plate <a href='#pl131a'>131<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The ironwork of the
balconies is especially rich and characteristic. In the interiors the exposed metal structure
and various elaborate incidental features, such as the lighting fixtures, participate fully in
the general pattern of organic curvature. Although plant-like in feeling, Horta’s metalwork
is quite as abstract as Gaudí’s grilles in the entrance arches of the
Palau Güell (Plate <a href='#pl096b'>96<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) and often achieves a comparable
distinction considered as craftsmanship.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house of Baron Van Eetvelde of 1895 at 4 Avenue Palmerston—the extension to
the left numbered 2 is considerably later—has a quite different exterior from the Solvay
house. The front has an almost Sullivanian range of arched bays consisting entirely of
exposed metalwork. Inside, the salon is even more of a masterpiece than the stair-hall of
the Tassel house. A circle of iron columns, curving up into elliptical arches, supports a
low dome of glass across which long leaf-like bands of transparent colour continue the
sinuous structural curves below. In a happy floral metaphor the lighting fixtures bend
and droop, each electric bulb shaded by a coloured glass bell of over-blown tulip shape.
Not since Nicholas Pineau developed the <i>pittoresque</i> version of the Rococo in the second
quarter of the eighteenth century had such elegant consistency and originality been seen
in the decorative exploitation of plant-like elements.</p>

<p class='c010'>Horta’s other fine houses in Brussels range in date down to the Wiener house of 1919
in the Avenue de l’Astronomie. After the very elegant and restrained Hallet house of
1906 at 346 Avenue Louise they became so dry and so formal that the term Art Nouveau
hardly applies to them, however. There are two much earlier examples at 23-25 Rue
Américaine, built in 1898, which are of special interest because Horta occupied them
himself. The virtuoso elaboration of the interwoven structural and decorative ironwork
of the oriel on the one to the left and the continuous ribbon-window set behind iron
mullions in the top storey of the other are among the most striking and original external
features he ever designed. These years at the very end of the century undoubtedly represent
the peak of his career. His most advanced domestic planning was to be seen in the
Aubecq house of 1900 at 520 Avenue Louise, demolished in 1950 (Figure <a href='#i290'>34</a>). There the
interflow of space between the interlocking octagonal reception rooms of the ground
storey comes very close to that found in certain early houses by Wright
(see Chapters <a href='#ch15'>15</a> and <a href='#ch19'>19</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Certainly Horta’s most important single work is the Maison du Peuple of 1896-9.
This was built for the city authorities of Brussels on a curiously-shaped site of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Horta took the fullest advantage. Extending around a segment of a circular <i>place</i> and
part way along two radial streets, the façade forms a continuous but irregular series of
curves, mostly concave, but with the main entrance placed in one of the shorter convex
portions. The greater part of the exterior wall consists of a visible skeleton of iron with
solid masonry sections defining the ends and the entrance bay. The vertical stanchions
are not curved, but many of the horizontal members are slightly arched. Decorative
metal elements at some of the intersections attempt, not altogether successfully, to give
to the structural grid the over-all organic quality so happily achieved in the Van Eetvelde
entrance hall. As in his houses, Horta had difficulty in assimilating the carved detail of
the stonework, here associated with wall panels of brick, to the metalwork; where the
two come close together, as in the entrance arch of mixed materials, the result is very
awkward indeed.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 34. Victor Horta: Brussels, Aubecq house, 1900, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Comparison with Sullivan’s work of these years is inevitable—there is really nothing
else of the precise period with which the Maison du Peuple can properly be compared.
With Sullivan the main structural members of metal are always covered with terracotta
and the visible metalwork is almost entirely decorative. Yet there is considerable similarity
in the way Sullivan handled the metal mullions at the entrances of the Carson,
Pirie &amp; Scott Store, mullions which rise into and interweave with the ornament
above, to Horta’s attempt to merge the structural and the decorative in his framework
of visible metal elements here.</p>

<p class='c010'>His greatest success at this was certainly in the auditorium at the top of the Maison du
Peuple. In this the openwork iron beams that support the roof, forming a sort of
hammerbeam system with the side galleries, have graceful and expressive but essentially
structural curves (Plate <a href='#pl132b'>132<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). To these the decorative railings of the galleries provide a
delicate and harmonious counterpoint in their intricately plant-like detailing. Around
the structural frame the auditorium is enclosed only by glass or by very thin panels held
in metal frames, rather like the ‘curtain-walls’ of the mid twentieth century; thus there
is in this permanent edifice a good deal of the volumetric lightness previously associated
with temporary exhibition buildings only.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among Horta’s commercial buildings in various Belgian cities the most conspicuous
was the Innovation Department Store of 1901 in the Rue Neuve in Brussels (Plate <a href='#pl131b'>131<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>The front, almost entirely of metal and glass though set in a granite frame, was a remarkable
example of Art Nouveau decorative design at fully architectural scale. The Innovation
completely overshadowed the equally bold but extremely coarse and clumsy Old
England Department Store just off the Place Royale in Brussels, also almost entirely of
iron and glass, that was built by Paul Saintenoy (1832-92) two years earlier. In the
Gros Waucquez Building in the Rue de Sable of 1903-5 and the Wolfers Building of
1906 in the Rue d’Arenberg, as in his houses of those later years, Horta’s treatment is
much more restrained than in the department store. Stone piers subdivide their façades,
curves are fewer and more structural, and there is much less ornament and almost no
exposed iron.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a historical paradox that Horta’s architectural career should have continued long
after the Art Nouveau was forgotten, bringing him in the end such public esteem and
material success as few other innovators of his generation ever knew. Yet his later work,
beginning with his Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, designed in 1914 just before the
First World War but begun only in 1923, and continuing down to his Central Station
there, begun in 1938 and only lately completed, is of purely local significance. What
brought him a peerage and a street named after him—that at the side of his Palais des
Beaux-Arts—was not his early work of the Art Nouveau years, standing with Sullivan’s
skyscrapers like a landmark at the beginning of modern architecture, but this later
official work which is almost totally without intrinsic interest and, in the case of the
station, actually rather monstrous. The contrast with Sullivan’s barren later years after
1904 is very striking.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the poetic justice that there might be in ignoring a Belgian who long
falsely claimed the credit for the invention of the Art Nouveau, one cannot turn to
other countries without mentioning the name of Henri Van de Velde (1863-1957).<a id="r378"></a><a href='#f378' class='c025'><sup>[378]</sup></a>
In 1892, when Horta designed the Tassel house, Van de Velde had not even begun to
practise architecture. His first work, which is his own house of 1895-6 at Uccle near
Brussels, though still rather conventional externally in a simple, almost peasant way
perhaps influenced by Voysey, included furniture more functional than Horta’s, if
much less elegant and imaginative. He also brought to Brussels—and later to Paris,
Berlin, and Weimar—an interpretation of Ruskin’s and Morris’s sociological approach
to the arts that had a wide and growing influence, for he pursued his mature career as
decorator, architect, and educator largely outside Belgium<a id="r379"></a><a href='#f379' class='c025'><sup>[379]</sup></a>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> initiation of the Art Nouveau by Horta in 1892 was sudden and its spread extremely
rapid. Almost concurrently forms very similar to those he had invented began
to appear in other European countries. Rarely has a new idea in the visual arts been taken
up internationally with so little lag. Advanced artistic circles at this time were evidently
thoroughly prepared to accept major innovations and new periodicals, starting up
almost one a year, provided vehicles for their transmission: <i>Pan</i> in 1895, for example,
<i>Jugend</i> in 1896, <i>Dekorative Kunst</i> in 1897, and <i>Die Kunst</i> in 1899, to mention only German
magazines. Had the Art Nouveau not already been invented by Horta the year
before, three works of art dated 1893, Aubrey Beardsley’s ‘Cello Player’, an illustration
in black and white, Toorop’s picture ‘Three Brides’, and Munch’s ‘The Cry’, first a
painting but widely available as a colour-lithograph the following year, might well have
supplied the impetus for other designers to do so; doubtless such inspiration did encourage
rivalry rather than direct imitation of Horta. In Germany a Munch exhibition
in Berlin in 1892 and a Toorop exhibition in Munich in 1893 called attention to the long
waving curves and the general linearity of style of these artists. In 1893, moreover, the
<i>Studio</i> began to bring to designers and architects everywhere well-chosen illustrations of
current English decorative work.</p>
<p class='c010'>England itself was least responsive to the new Continental mode. It is, indeed, improper
to call the Bishopsgate Institute in Bishopsgate in the City of London, built in
1893-4 by C. Harrison Townsend (1850-1928), Art Nouveau. Yet, despite its evident
dependence on Webb, the way in which Townsend took the characteristically stylized
but basically naturalistic patterns of contemporary English wallpapers and chintzes and
used them in relief at architectural scale is as drastic an innovation as are the bits and
pieces of more abstract stone carving that Horta used on his Brussels houses of these
years. Townsend remained a ‘fellow-traveller’ rather than a member of the international
Art Nouveau group for a decade. For example, the façade of his Whitechapel
Art Gallery in the Whitechapel Road in the East End of London, designed in 1895 and
built in 1897-9, is an improved version of that of the Bishopsgate
Institute (Plate <a href='#pl134b'>134<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The broad and almost Richardsonian
arch is placed off centre, the ornament is freer and bolder, and the
few windows are organized in a continuous band below the plain wall of
the upper portion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Less successful, though perhaps more advanced, is Townsend’s Horniman Museum of
1900-1, a free-standing edifice in London Road, Forest Hill, south of London. This has
less external ornamentation, except for the façade mosaic by Anning Bell, but there is a
very plastically conceived tower with rounded corners placed at one side of the front
façade. His church of St Mary the Virgin, consecrated in 1904, at Great Warley in Essex,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>is very simple, indeed rather Voysey-like as regards the buttressed and roughcast exterior.
However, the elaborate decorations inside by Sir William Reynolds-Stephens
(1862-1943) offer the most virtuoso example of Art Nouveau in England—at least they
are about as close to the Continental mode as the English came.<a id="r380"></a><a href='#f380' class='c025'><sup>[380]</sup></a> No other English architect
came nearer the Art Nouveau than Townsend; in quality, moreover, his work
excels most of that done on the Continent by the various imitators and emulators of
Horta, even if it lacks the humble integrity of Voysey’s best houses of these years.</p>

<p class='c010'>The earliest and, later, the most versatile Art Nouveau architect of France<a id="r381"></a><a href='#f381' class='c025'><sup>[381]</sup></a> was
Hector Guimard (1867-1942). But his first work of consequence, the complex block of
flats in Paris called the Castel Béranger<a id="r382"></a><a href='#f382' class='c025'><sup>[382]</sup></a> at 16 Rue La Fontaine, which was completed
after several years of construction in 1897, still represents a very ambiguous exploitation
of the new ideas coming from Brussels. It must be remembered, however, that the
original design almost certainly antedates by a year or two all other Art Nouveau work
outside Belgium. Also notable is the fact that the façade of the Castel Béranger was
premiated by the City of Paris in 1898, since this indicates the rapidity with which the
new mode won approval in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1896, while the Castel Béranger was building, Siegfried Bing, a Hamburg art-dealer
whose wares included Japanese prints—now even more in demand than at any
time since their introduction to Europe in the late fifties—and also the new English
decorative products, decided to open a shop in Paris. Bing’s Maison de l’Art Nouveau
at 22 Rue de Provence was designed for him by L.-B. Bonnier (1856-1946) in the Belgian
mode, which thereby acquired its familiar name. This shop was of no great architectural
interest, however, except that it was the first of the multitude that were produced
in the next ten or fifteen years. Not only in Paris but in most Continental cities
large and small, and even in England and in America, where the Art Nouveau otherwise
hardly penetrated, these shop-fronts can still be noted; one of the finest has even been
transferred from Paris to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in America.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bing also enlisted the services of Van de Velde, still quite immature as a designer compared
to Horta, but very articulate as a critic. Influenced more intellectually than visually
by the English, Van de Velde’s personal development as a decorator now proceeded very
rapidly. The lounge he designed for the Dresden Exhibition of 1897, for example, was
an accomplished if somewhat heavily scaled example of an Art Nouveau interior and
much more elaborate than those completed in his house at Uccle the year before.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the time the Maison du Peuple in Brussels opened three years later in 1899 and
Horta’s early career reached its apex of achievement, the Art Nouveau was already
a favourite mode with young French designers and generally in rising favour in
<i>fin de siècle</i> Paris. As a result even established architects were not averse to introducing
its curves in interior decoration and for the detailing of exposed metal structural elements,
although most of them had little understanding of its real possibilities. The giant
stone colonnades of the Grand Palais in Paris, designed in 1897 and built in 1898-9 for
the Exhibition of 1900, were presumably intended to rival those of the plaster palaces of
the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893; but behind them the architectural team of H.-A.-A.
Deglane (1855-1931), L.-A. Louvet (1860-1936), both pupils of Richardson’s master,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>André, and A.-F.-T. Thomas (1847-1907) provided a vast iron-and-glass interior detailed
in a coarse sort of Art Nouveau way that is quite unrelated to the academic treatment
of the exterior.<a id="r383"></a><a href='#f383' class='c025'><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The entrance feature, designed by René Binet (1866-1911), and the Pavilion Bleu by
E.-A.-R. Dulong (1860-?), the principal exhibition restaurant in the Champ de Mars,
were even more whole-heartedly <i>à la mode</i>. One can hardly regret, however, that these
gaudy structures, unlike the Grand Palais, were only temporary. A much superior
example of Art Nouveau decoration, Maxim’s Restaurant in the Rue Royale, remains
intact as it was redecorated in 1899 by Louis Marney. This is full of period flavour and
still splendidly maintained, but it has no real existence as interior architecture. Soon the
Art Nouveau would be vulgarized in dozens of cafés, large and small, all over Europe.
Of these the Brasserie Universelle in the Avenue de l’Opéra in Paris by Niermans, carried
out two or three years after Maxim’s and lately demolished, was perhaps the most
sumptuous; there, however, the new mode was eclectically combined with a lush Neo-Rococo.<a id="r384"></a><a href='#f384' class='c025'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The architect Charles Plumet (1861-1925), working with the decorator Tony
Selmersheim (b. 1871), built in 1898 at 67 Avenue Malakoff the first of a series of houses
in which Art Nouveau decoration was grafted on to a general scheme of design that was
more or less Late Gothic. This has also been demolished. Such eclecticism, based more
usually on eighteenth-century models, is characteristic of the rapid Parisian dilution of
the Art Nouveau and doubtless played a great part in its early descent into the obsolescence
of the <i>démodé</i>. Yet Auguste Perret (1874-1954), in a large block of flats built in
1902 at 119 Avenue de Wagram, exploited in masonry a heavier and richer sort of Art
Nouveau than Plumet’s with considerable success (Plate <a href='#pl134a'>134<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). This edifice is in curious
contrast to the flats of ferro-concrete at 25 bis Rue Franklin, designed by Perret in 1902
also, with which his career is generally considered to begin. Even the latter, moreover,
have considerably more Art Nouveau feeling in their panels of faience mosaic than is
usually recognized (see Chapter <a href='#ch18'>18</a>). The block in the Avenue Wagram is quite typical
of French production in these years but of much higher than average quality.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most accomplished French Art Nouveau designer remained Guimard, the first to
take up the mode. His most conspicuous works, however, the Paris Métro entrances of
1898-1901, lie outside the normal realm of architecture (Plate <a href='#pl137b'>137<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). These are executed
entirely in metal of the most sinuous and vegetable-like character, and their extreme virtuosity
is the more surprising in that they consist of metal castings produced in series.
His no longer extant Humbert de Romans Building of 1902 in the Rue Saint-Didier in
Paris, on the other hand, illustrated the usual difficulties of Art Nouveau architects when
working with masonry. The exterior was neither Neo-Rococo nor Neo-Flamboyant
but curiously crude and gawky in its originality, like his Castel Béranger, with none of
the Art Nouveau grace that even Plumet sometimes evoked with success, or the rather
lush ornamentation of Perret’s block of flats in the Avenue Wagram. The auditorium
inside, however, employed curved structural members even more boldly than Horta had
done in that of the Maison du Peuple. Here Guimard succeeded in giving a masculine
vigour to the rather feminine forms of a mode already passing its brief prime.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>As late as 1911, however, Guimard remained faithful to the Art Nouveau in an extensive
range of contiguous blocks of flats that he built at 17-21 Rue La Fontaine near the
Castel Béranger. For his own flat there he designed ironwork as boldly abstract as advanced
mid twentieth-century sculpture in metal, but also as suavely elegant as comparable
Rococo detail of the eighteenth century. The exteriors, moreover, which are
entirely of stone, have a great deal of the refinement and restraint of Horta’s Hallet
house of 1906 in Brussels. They are, however, more plastically treated with boldly
moulded bay windows and attic storeys. Except for Perret’s, few Parisian blocks of flats
of the period rival these in interest or in quality of design and execution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three Paris department stores of the early years of the century continued to use the
metal-and-glass interior structure of Boileau and Eiffel’s Bon Marché, with notable success.
In presumable emulation of Horta’s Innovation in Brussels, moreover, the architects
of two of these extended considerably the external use of exposed metal introduced
by Sédille at the Printemps in the eighties. These two stores remain, with Guimard’s
Métro entrances, the most prominent Parisian examples of the Art Nouveau. The main
branch of the Samaritaine<a id="r385"></a><a href='#f385' class='c025'><sup>[385]</sup></a> in the Rue de la Monnaie near the Pont Neuf was built in
1905 by C.-R.-F.-M. Jourdain (1847-1935). This has several fine galleried courts inside
in the tradition of the Galeries du Commerce et de l’Industrie of the 1830s, but it is even
more distinguished for the sturdy scale and the straightforward design of the external
metal frame (Plate <a href='#pl133'>133</a>). The actual structural members are hardly bent at all by the
exigencies of the mode; but they were characteristically ornamented not only with
decorative metalwork but also with inset panels of polychrome faience, now painted
over. On the north front, however, other panels, here of faience mosaic, remain visible;
these are of even greater delicacy and elegance than Perret’s foliate panels in his block of
flats of 1902-3 in the Rue Franklin.</p>

<p class='c010'>The contemporary Grand Bazar de la Rue de Rennes, now the Magasins Réunis, at
134-136 Rue de Rennes by H.-B. Gutton (b. 1874) is generally fussier in design than the
Samaritaine. Gutton achieved, however, a more completely volumetric expression, emphasizing
the lightness and the thinness of metal-and-glass construction somewhat as the
early monuments of the 1840s and 1850s in England had done. New shop-windows below
and the removal of the open grillework that once rose against the sky have now
much diminished its effectiveness. Binet’s earlier galleried court of 1900 at the Printemps
was burned out in 1923, unfortunately. With the lifts rising in the corners and the staircases
swooping down in great splashing curves, this court was altogether superior to his
Entrance to the Exhibition of 1900 and even to Frantz Jourdain’s small later courts in the
Samaritaine. It seemed somehow to epitomize what a great metropolitan department
store <i>ought</i> to look like somewhat as Garnier’s Opéra epitomizes what later generations
came to expect of an opera-house. If Prince Danilo supped with the ‘damen’ of Maxim’s,
we can be sure the ‘Merry Widow’ and the ‘Pink Lady’ did their shopping here.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the Art Nouveau structures at the Exhibition of 1900 which first focused public
attention on the new mode, occasioning also that rapid Parisian vulgarization which
brought its early end. At the exhibition, besides the crude but conspicuous things designed
by Binet and Dulong that have been mentioned, there was the Pavillon Art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Nouveau Bing by Georges de Feure (1868-1928), a designer rather than an architect,
which had rooms by Edward Colonna, back from working for Tiffany in America, and
others of the best artists and craftsmen employed by Bing; but their exhibits represented
decoration, not interior architecture properly speaking. However, by 1900 the Art
Nouveau was not at all the strictly Parisian manifestation that it must have seemed to
most of those who visited the exhibition. The Germans, notably, had already taken it up
with great enthusiasm, beginning about 1897.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Studio Elvira of 1897-8 in Munich by August Endell (1871-1925) had a plain
stucco façade cut by a few strategically placed windows of varied shape; but this façade
was splashed across the centre with a very large abstract relief of orientalizing character
resembling something half-way between a dragon and a cloud. Endell’s studio, if not the
first manifestation of the Art Nouveau in Germany, was certainly the most striking;
moreover, it followed immediately upon the showing of Van de Velde’s Lounge at the
Dresden Exhibition of 1897. Already, however, in that portion of the Wertheim Department
Store in Berlin in the Leipzigerstrasse which was begun in 1896, Alfred Messel
(1853-1909) had used a great deal of exposed metal and glass and even perhaps modified
the detail a bit towards the Art Nouveau. This was five years before Horta designed
the Innovation Department Store in Brussels and ten years earlier than Jourdain’s Samaritaine
in Paris. Messel made the spacing of his heavily moulded masonry piers quite wide
and opened up completely the bays between. The result was at least as close to Sullivan’s
Gage Building of 1898-9 as to the Paris department stores of a decade later. In those
portions of this department store that Messel added in 1900-4, however, the façades,
although highly stylized, were of rather Late Gothic character and certainly quite remote
from the Art Nouveau.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1899 Van de Velde moved from Paris to Berlin. There he designed the Hohenzollern
Kunstgewerbehaus, a shop parallel to Bing’s Maison de l’Art Nouveau in Paris in
its interests and its activities. In the next year he carried out the Haby Barber Shop and
the Havana Cigar Store, two of the most extravagant of all Art Nouveau shop interiors.
With the opening of the new century, however, in his full-scale architecture Van de
Velde moved almost as rapidly away from the Art Nouveau as did Messel, although in
a different direction (see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>). By this time strong counter-influences were reaching
Germany from Glasgow and Vienna.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although not disdaining the Art Nouveau as completely as did the English and the
Americans, the Austrians showed little of the enthusiasm of the French and the
Germans. There is in Vienna one block of flats<a id="r386"></a><a href='#f386' class='c025'><sup>[386]</sup></a> of about 1900 so completely Art
Nouveau that it might well have been designed by Horta himself. But the leading Austrian
architects, old and young, reflected the new Belgian mode only with considerable
diffidence and restraint. Otto Wagner (1841-1918), long a well-established academic
architect and indeed Professor of Architecture at the Akademie, introduced more and
more Art Nouveau detail in the Stadtbahn stations that he built over the years 1894-1901,
most notably in the one at the Karlsplatz with its curved metal frame and inset
floral panels. However, even this seems tentative and hardly rivals in interest Guimard’s
contemporary Métro stations in Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Wagner’s so-called Majolika Haus, a block of flats at 40 Linke Wienzeile designed
about 1898, is far more distinguished and original (Plate <a href='#pl138a'>138<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Although the ironwork
of the balconies is here and there curvilinear in detail and the faience plaques that completely
cover the wall are decorated with great swooping patterns of highly colourful
flowers, the architectonic elements of the façade are nevertheless very crisp, flat, and
rectangular. That Vienna would very shortly become the focus of a reaction against the
Art Nouveau does not seem surprising in the light of this façade. Moreover, on an office
building erected in the Ungargasse for the firm of Portois &amp; Fix in 1897 by Max Fabiani
(b. 1865), who had been Wagner’s assistant in 1894-6, the coloured faience slabs which
sheathe its surface are arranged in a purely geometrical chequer-board pattern; only
the ironwork has a slightly Art Nouveau flavour. In the late nineties it would be hard
to say whether Art Nouveau influence was arriving or departing but for the projects
other Viennese architects were publishing in the review <i>Ver Sacrum</i> started in 1898.</p>

<p class='c010'>The design of the art gallery built in the Friedrichstrasse in Vienna in 1898-9 for the
Sezession, a newly founded society of artists in revolt against the Academy, by J. M.
Olbrich (1867-1908) seems more influenced, however, by the façade of Townsend’s
Whitechapel Art Gallery—only just begun but already published as a project in the
<i>Studio</i> in 1895—than by the work of the Belgians or the French, which had affected
him strongly in the immediately preceding years. The pierced dome of floral metalwork
alone vies in virtuosity with Horta or Guimard, and the pattern of this is actually
quite English in character. The bronze doors are by Gustav Klimt, an Austrian Post-Impressionist
who can be grouped, up to a point, with the Dutch, Belgian, Norwegian,
and Swiss Post-Impressionists mentioned earlier (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). Olbrich was called
to Darmstadt in Germany to work at the artists’ colony sponsored there by the Grand
Duke Ernst Ludwig in 1899 and Darmstadt, like Vienna, soon became a centre of reaction
against the Art Nouveau under his leadership (see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Both in Vienna and in Darmstadt the influence of the Scottish designer Mackintosh
helped most to crystallize an alternative mode. Mackintosh first exhibited a room on
the Continent at Munich in 1898, the same year that Baillie Scott was called by the
Grand Duke to decorate an interior in the palace at Darmstadt. In 1900 Mackintosh was
invited to design a room in the Sezession Exhibition in Vienna. That exhibit undoubtedly
encouraged Viennese architects, already diffident towards the Art Nouveau,
to turn very sharply away from it. This Adolf Loos (1870-1933) had already done in
designing a completely rectilinear shop interior in Vienna in 1898. Loos, Wagner after
about 1901, and Wagner’s pupil Josef Hoffmann (1870-1956) were all leaders in the
international reaction against the Art Nouveau (see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>). The position of Mackintosh,
however, is rather hard to state so categorically and must be considered here in
more detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>At home in Scotland Mackintosh’s early decorative work of the mid nineties approached
Continental Art Nouveau more closely than that of any other Briton, not
excluding Townsend. Indeed, he was castigated by his compatriots and his English contemporaries
for participating in so exotic a movement. But Mackintosh also came nearer
to possessing genius than most of the men of his generation associated with the Art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Nouveau, not even excluding Horta. That genius, all the same, was of so ambivalent a
nature that he could seem for a few years to go along with the general stream of Continental
fashion and yet, almost at the very same time, provide also a real protest against
its excesses and its superficialities by the craftsmanlike integrity and the almost ascetic
restraint of his best work. That protest the Austrians and the Germans were not slow to
heed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mackintosh made his first mark in Glasgow, which had earlier been the home of the
highly original ‘Greek’ Thomson (see Chapter <a href='#ch04'>4</a>). By the nineties, moreover, interest in
contemporary French painting was probably livelier there than it was in London. But
Glasgow was also as notorious as Chicago, that major focus of architectural achievement
in the America of the nineties, for its presumed philistinism. Touches of Mackintosh’s
hand can be distinguished in work of the office of John Honeyman (1831-1914) and his
partner Keppie, where the young architect was employed at the start of his career, notably
in the Martyrs’ Public School in Glasgow of 1895. But it was in the decoration of the
first of a series of Miss Cranston’s ‘tea-rooms’ (<i>scottice</i>, restaurants), the one in Buchanan
Street remodelled by him in 1897-8, that Mackintosh’s personal talents were first effectively
exploited. His very earliest decorative compositions and the murals that he and his
wife provided here, full of heavy and presumably Gaelic symbolism, are parallel to,
rather than derivative from, the work of the Belgians. They are, in fact, much closer to
the drawings of Beardsley and the paintings of Toorop and Munch than to the plant-like
ironwork and almost Neo-Rococo carved stone ornament characteristic of Horta. But
the same long swinging curves are present, the same linearity, and the same rejection
of all stylistic influence from the past.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this same year 1897 Mackintosh’s firm had the good fortune to win the limited
competition for the Glasgow School of Art with a project that was entirely their young
designer’s (Plate <a href='#pl132a'>132<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Thus he very soon had an opportunity to prove himself architect
as well as decorator in a way that only two or three of the Europeans associated with the
Art Nouveau had been able to do up to this point. The school was built during the next
two years, just as Horta was finishing his Maison du Peuple in Brussels. The only element
in the design that relates to the contemporary Art Nouveau of the Continent is the ironwork.
This is quite incidental to the major architectonic qualities of the building, moreover,
since it is purely decorative, not structural. It is also extremely restrained in its
abstract curves, like Fabiani’s of this date in Vienna, and almost totally devoid of vegetable
or floral reminiscence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The entrance to the Glasgow Art School seems to derive from Webb, but, like that of
Townsend’s contemporary art gallery in London, it is rather less traditional in character
than Webb’s work of this period. The somewhat wilful asymmetry and the plastic
elaboration of the central part of the façade contrast nevertheless with the straightforwardness
of the general treatment. There are two ranges of very wide studio windows—reputedly
derived from a Voysey project—like ‘Chicago windows’ but larger,
with the reinforced-concrete lintels above them frankly exposed, and little else in the
whole composition. To later eyes this façade, expressing so clearly the uncomplicated
plan that it fronts, tends to appear deceptively simple and obvious. But Mackintosh’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>very sensitive proportions and the delicate touches of linear detail provided by the ironwork
create a design at once very direct and very subtle.</p>

<p class='c010'>The north end of the building is a tall plain wall of rather small-scaled random ashlar
broken only by a few strategically spotted windows of various shapes. At once medievally
dramatic and quite abstract, this façade makes one appreciate all the more the almost
classical serenity and horizontality of the main front. The Art School is clearly the
manifesto of an architectural talent of broad range and great assurance—very different
indeed from that of Voysey.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mackintosh was not alone in Glasgow in these years. A real ‘school’ existed, chiefly in
the field of decoration, of which George Walton was another notable exponent.<a id="r387"></a><a href='#f387' class='c025'><sup>[387]</sup></a> Like
Baillie Scott and Ashbee, Walton had some success as an architect in England (see Chapter
15) as Mackintosh did not, even though he executed a few interiors below the Border.
But local support was not what it should have been for any of them in either Scotland
or England. While the Art School was in construction, however, Mackintosh was asked
in 1898 to provide the already-mentioned room in Munich, first of many that he showed
at various exhibitions in Germany and Austria. This interior was very different indeed,
both in the basic rectangularity of the forms and in the delicacy of the membering, from
Van de Velde’s Art Nouveau Lounge at the Dresden Exhibition of the previous year.
Thus, even before Van de Velde reached Berlin in 1899, a new line of influence from
Glasgow into Germany—and soon into Austria also—was established whose general
tendency was in sharp opposition to the lusher currents flowing from Brussels and Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Olbrich settled in Darmstadt—just <i>before</i> Mackintosh’s room was shown
at the Sezession—he also rejected almost completely in the work he carried out at the
Grand Duke’s Art Colony the still slightly Art Nouveau leanings—in any case already
closer to the English Townsend than to Horta or Van de Velde—of his newly completed
Sezession Building (see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>). Only his Pavilion of the Plastic Arts of 1901 at
Darmstadt retained curved elements, and those were structural rather than merely
decorative. The general rectangularity and the broad horizontal windows of the Ernst
Ludwig Haus, a block of artists’ studios also completed by Olbrich in 1901, suggest
comparison with Mackintosh’s Glasgow School of Art. Whether or not, in fact, Olbrich
knew Mackintosh’s building—he may well have seen drawings if not photographs of it—his
approach here was certainly very similar.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mackintosh had a good many further opportunities as a decorator, both at home and
abroad, but only too few commissions to design whole buildings. However, his two
houses near Glasgow, Windy Hill at Kilmacolm of 1899-1901 and Hill House at Helensburgh
of 1902-3, are both very notable. Externally they have a certain generic similarity
to Voysey’s, with their moderate pitched roofs of dark slate, roughcast walls, and plain
stone trim. His prototypes are not English but Scottish, however—the simple seventeenth-century
houses of the minor lairds. As one would expect from his interiors, moreover,
the façades of Mackintosh’s houses are much more carefully and abstractly composed
than Voysey’s; they even include some simple geometrical features that are not at
all reminiscent of the past in their design. Like Voysey’s houses, Mackintosh’s show no
real novelties in planning, although the disposition of the rooms is always straightforward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and commodious. The interiors are very original and rather less forced than those he
was producing for exhibitions on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mackintosh built very little after 1903 except the Scotland Street School of 1904 in
Glasgow, the north wing of the Glasgow Art School in 1907-8, and the finest of the
various tea-rooms that he remodelled for Miss Cranston. This was the Willow Tea
Room in Sauchiehall Street of 1904, for which he remade the façade as well as reorganizing
the interior. Internally this tea-room was arranged on several interrelated
levels subdivided by ingenious screenwork; the exterior was a flat surface of white
stucco cut by broad horizontal openings, one to a storey. The Scotland Street School is
equally straightforward in design, the rather plain façade with its ranges of horizontal
windows being flanked by rounded stair-towers articulated into continuous stone grids
by mullions and transoms, like the bay windows of Voysey’s Broadleys but much taller.</p>

<p class='c010'>The north wing of the Glasgow Art School is more remarkable, quite worthy of the
original front but much more stylized (Plate <a href='#pl135a'>135<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Where the front is strongly horizontal
the new end façade, like that on the south, is markedly vertical, in part because of
the way the ground falls off. But the tall oriels, glazed at the outer plane of the stonework,
are striking features, and the whole composition is tense and dramatic. The
library inside is a <i>tour de force</i> of spatial subdivision somewhat like the Willow Tea Room.
Most notable is the way the rectangular stick-work makes manifest the complex articulation
of the total volume. This sort of handling of interior space was unique up to this
time as a product of conscious design, although already present inside Paxton’s Crystal
Palace in the mid nineteenth century. Certainly there is no evidence here of a decline
in Mackintosh’s creative powers; indeed, quite the contrary. Yet this library proved
to be his swan song; for want of further commissions Mackintosh’s career all but
closed at much the same time that the Art Nouveau was coming to an end on the
Continent. Not since Ledoux perhaps had so great a talent been thus thwarted by
circumstances, although just what the thwarting circumstances were, other than
Mackintosh’s own temperament, is not so evident as in the case of the revolutionary
French architect.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Art Nouveau, so extensively propagated by exhibitions, is often thought to have
terminated with an exhibition, that held at Turin in 1902. This is more than a slight
exaggeration, as various already mentioned buildings executed as late as 1911 will have
made evident. Yet after the early years of the century the decline of the Art Nouveau
was almost universal except in provincial places and in outlying countries such as those
of Latin America and eastern Europe. At Turin the Belgian section had characteristic
Art Nouveau interiors by Horta. Mackintosh, wholly detached by now from the Art
Nouveau, contributed a Rose Boudoir, typically light in colour and delicate in line with
the predominant verticals and horizontals relieved by little abstract knots, so to say, of
curvilinear decoration. Raimondo D’Aronco (1857-1932), the Italian architect responsible
for the principal pavilions, wavered between a rather plastic, somewhat Neo-Baroque,
version of the Art Nouveau, not unrelated to the seventeenth-century work
of the great local architect Guarino Guarini, and a crisper mode much influenced by
Mackintosh and the Viennese.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>D’Aronco’s finest building, however, was not at Turin but the Pavilion of Fine Arts
that he designed for the Udine Exhibition the next year. Moving sharply away from the
turgidity of much of his work at the earlier exhibition, he produced for Udine a façade
that was unified in design, frankly impermanent in its materials, and at once festive in
spirit and dignified in tone. This was a most distinguished piece of exhibition architecture
in a period when leading designers gave a great part of their attention to such rather
ephemeral things—largely, doubtless, because so few opportunities to build permanent
structures came their way. In Istanbul, D’Aronco built a small mosque in 1903, prominently
located by the Galata Bridge, and also several blocks of flats that signally fail to
maintain the promise of his Italian exhibition buildings. The very awkwardly sited
mosque, raised on top of an existing structure, is as Viennese in character as the Udine
pavilion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other Italian architects, however, remained faithful for a few years to the <i>stile floreale</i>,
their version of the Art Nouveau. In Milan the Casa Castiglione, a <i>palazzo</i> or mansion-like
block of flats at 47 Corso Venezia built by Giuseppe Sommaruga (1867-1917) in
1903, is a very large and ponderous example. The detail is extremely bold, inside and
out, the materials rich, and a very large part of the interior is given up to a monumental
stair-hall of almost Piranesian spatial complexity. A Milanese hotel at 15 Corso Vittorio
Emmanuele of 1904-5 by A. Cattaneo and G. Santamaria is of a comparable extravagance.
Finer perhaps, certainly simpler, is the Casa Tosi of 1910 at 28 Via Senato in Milan by
Alfredo Campanini (1873-1926).<a id="r388"></a><a href='#f388' class='c025'><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>To judge from the rather <i>stile floreale</i> character of some work of this period in Latin
America, Italians as well as Iberians may well have carried the Art Nouveau there. In
Cuba and Brazil, especially, memories of Colonial exuberance encouraged a profusion of
carved or moulded ornament beyond even the excesses of the French around 1900. The
most prominent example, but not the most characteristic, is the Palacio de Bellas Artes in
Mexico City begun for President Diaz by Adamo Boari after 1903 and completed in
1933 by Federico Mariscal; this is ‘Beaux-Arts’—not inappropriately, perhaps—in all
except its detailing; in the latest portions this reflects the Paris of the Exposition des
Arts Décoratifs of 1925 rather than the Art Nouveau Paris of 1900.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Spain itself the international current of the Art Nouveau was not very influential
outside Barcelona. Gaudí, whose earlier work of the seventies and eighties has
already been described (see Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a>), continued to be as much apart from
the contemporary Spanish architectural scene as he was from the international Art
Nouveau. His finest late works, moreover, all but post-date the demise of the Art
Nouveau in the major European capitals. Nor is there any such close, if ambivalent,
linkage between Gaudí’s career and the general rise and fall of the mode as in the case of
Mackintosh. One can only say that his personal style is more closely related to the Art
Nouveau than to the new stage of modern architecture that was already succeeding it
by the time he produced his final masterpieces. The premonitory character of his early
ironwork has been discussed and illustrated already (Plate <a href='#pl096b'>96<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Gaudí’s work on the church of the Sagrada Familia<a id="r389"></a><a href='#f389' class='c025'><sup>[389]</sup></a> in Barcelona went on more or
less continuously from 1884 to 1914 and began again in 1919 after the First World War.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>The most conspicuous portion that has so far been executed, one of the transept façades,
was designed and largely built in the nineties. Dominating Barcelona with its four extraordinary
towers—not finally completed until after Gaudí’s death in 1926—this façade,
begun in 1891, breaks quite sharply with the Neo-Gothic of Villar’s crypt and his own
chevet. The portals with their steep gables have a generically Gothic <i>ordonnance</i>; but
the extraordinary profusion of sculpture, mostly executed after 1903, gives a highly
novel flavour. While conventional enough as regards the figures, this is otherwise either
naturalistically floral or else meltingly abstract. It resembles the Art Nouveau in many
minor details, but is generally bolder in scale, more fully three-dimensional, and, in
places, somewhat nightmarish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although only about two-thirds as tall as the cluster of towers intended by Gaudí to
rise over the crossing, the four openwork spires above this façade—with the two in the
centre taller than those on the sides—reach a wholly disproportionate height in relation
to the roof that should ultimately cover the still unbuilt transept. At the top they break out
into fantastically plastic finials whose multi-planar surfaces are covered with a mosaic of
broken tiling in brilliant colours. The prototypes for these finials are the chimney-pots
of the Palau Güell, but here their note of free fantasy is raised to monumental scale. The
inspiration of the towers, so remote in character from anything that the Art Nouveau
ever produced, came from certain native buildings which Gaudí had seen in Africa:
these strange primitive<a id="r390"></a><a href='#f390' class='c025'><sup>[390]</sup></a> forms he first exploited in a project of 1892-3 for the Spanish
Franciscan Mission in Tangier which was never executed.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>In posse</i> the Sagrada Familia is perhaps the greatest ecclesiastical monument of the last
hundred years; beside it such a suave late example of monumental Neo-Gothic in
England as Liverpool Cathedral, begun by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott in 1903, lacks
both vitality and originality of expression, if not nobility of scale. However, Gaudí’s
church still remains a fragment, and a very incoherent one at that, even though he
prepared in 1925, the year before his death, a brilliant new project for the nave. Gaudí
really stands or falls by the few secular buildings that he was able to carry to completion,
beginning with the Palau Güell of 1886-9 (Plate <a href='#pl096b'>96<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), and not, as many compatriots
assume, by the unrealized—perhaps unrealizable—plans for the Sagrada Familia.
(Construction has gone slowly forward, however, on the other transept for a decade
now.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Gaudí’s next Barcelona mansion after the Palau Güell, that built at 48 Carrer de Casp
for the heirs of Pedro Mártir Calvet in 1898-1904, is much less impressive. Baroque
rather than medieval in its antecedents, this is interesting chiefly for the detailing of the
ironwork; but even that is no more remarkable here than that at the Palau Güell of
a decade earlier. It is of interest, however, as illustrating the support which Gaudí received
all along from his fellow citizens, that the Casa Calvet was awarded a prize in
1901 as the best new façade in Barcelona, quite as Guimard’s Castel Béranger was
premiated three years earlier in Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>A wholly new spirit, quite comparable in its total originality to the Art Nouveau,
first appears in the work that Gaudí did for Don Eusebio Güell at the Park Güell (now
the Municipal Park of Barcelona), carried out over the years 1900-14, and in the walls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and the gate he built in 1901-2 for the suburban estate of Don Hermenegildo Miralles in
Las Corts de Sarriá. In the latter all the forms are curved and no stylistic reminiscence
whatsoever remains, but it is a production of minor importance compared to the
park. The park is mostly landscaping, but partly architecture in that it includes several
small buildings and much subsidiary construction. A sort of Neo-Romantic naturalism,
exceeding in fantasy that of the most exotic landscape gardening of the eighteenth century,
controls the whole conception. Sinuous and megalomaniac near-Doric colonnades
of concrete support a sort of flat vault that is of great interest technically;<a id="r391"></a><a href='#f391' class='c025'><sup>[391]</sup></a> yet these colonnades
also suggest artificial ruins of the eighteenth-century sort raised to giant scale.
The other porticoes and grottoes, however, recall no architecture of the past. Their
rubble columns seem rather to emulate slanting tree-trunks, but in fact their profiles were
worked out statically with the most careful study of the forces involved.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ranges of curving benches surrounding the great open terrace over the Doric
hypostyle, although covered with a mosaic of the most heterogeneous bits and pieces of
broken faience, seem like congelations of the waves of the sea; the roofs of the lodges,
also tile-covered, toss in the air like cockscombs. A strange biological plasticity, rather
like that of the small-scale carved detail of Horta’s or Guimard’s buildings very much
enlarged, turns whole structures into malleable masses as in some Gulliverian dream of
vegetable or animal elements grown to monumental size. Everything but the ironwork
is moulded in three dimensions, and even the ironwork tends towards a heavy scale
more comparable to that of the structural members of metal used in Belgian or French
work of the day than to the delicacy of Art Nouveau decorative detail.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gaudí’s major secular works belong to the same years as the execution of the park. It
is hard to believe that the Casa Batlló at 43 Passeig de Gracia in Barcelona, a small block
of flats, is not a completely new structure but a remodelling carried out in 1905-7. This
fact perhaps explains the relative flatness of the façade. Yet Gaudí made the lower storeys
extraordinarily plastic and open, using a bony articulation of curvilinear stone members,
and the high roof in front that masks the roof terrace is of even more cockscomb-like
character than those on his park lodges (Plate <a href='#pl136'>136</a>). The upper storeys of the façade
glitter with a fantastic plaquage of broken coloured glass considerably more subtle in
tonality than his usual mosaic of faience fragments.<a id="r392"></a><a href='#f392' class='c025'><sup>[392]</sup></a> But architecturally the façade is
handled more like Horta’s, with most of the windows nearly rectangular even though
bulging balconettes of metal project at their bases. The effect, as with Horta, is slightly
Neo-Rococo. But the sort of Rococo which this façade recalls is not circumspect
French eighteenth-century work but the lusher mode that was exploited in Bavaria
and Austria—and still more appositely in Portugal and Spain. The entire wall surface
seems to be in motion, and all its edges waver and wind in a way that even interior
panelling did rarely in eighteenth-century France. This effect of total motion is even
more notable in the interiors, which seem to have been hollowed out by the waves of
the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rear façade of the Casa Batlló is remarkable for its openness. The wide window-walls
in the paired flats open on to sinuous balconies extending all the way across.
Above, there is a simpler plastic cresting than on the front; over this the curious forms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>of the chimney-pots provide a range of abstract sculptural features covered with polychrome
tiling, always a favourite terminal theme of Gaudí’s.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 35. Antoni Gaudí: Barcelona, Casa Milá, 1905-10, plan of typical floor</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Much larger than the Casa Batlló is the edifice built for Roser Segimon de Milá in
1905-7 at 92 Passeig de Gracia, appropriately known in Barcelona as ‘La Pedrera’ (the
quarry). Surrounding two more or less circular courts, this large block of flats occupies
an obtuse corner site, and the entire plan is worked out in curves as well as all the elements
of the exterior (Figure <a href='#i304'>35</a>). The façade of the Casa Milá is not a thin plane, curling
like paper at the edges and pierced with squarish holes like that of the Casa Batlló; instead
ranges of balconies heavier than those on the rear of the Casa Batlló sway in and
out like the waves of the sea beneath the foamlike crest of the roof, making the whole
edifice a very complex plastic entity (Plate <a href='#pl137a'>137<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). From a distance La Pedrera looks as if
it were all freely modelled in clay; in fact, it is executed in cut stone with boldly hammered
surfaces that appear to result from natural erosion.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is no external polychromy of glass or tile here, and the frescoed colour used on
the court walls has suffered such serious deterioration that it is difficult to know what it
was like originally. On the other hand, Gaudí’s detail was never more carefully studied
nor more consistent; there are no straight lines at all, and in the forms of the piers rising
from the ground to support the balconies of the first storey he suggested natural formations
with real success (Plate <a href='#pl135b'>135<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). These elements look as if they had been produced
by the action of sea and weather rather than by the chisel, quite as does much of the
mid-twentieth-century sculpture of Henry Moore.</p>

<p class='c010'>The marine note is seen at its strongest and most naturalistic in the ironwork however.
Strewn over the balcony parapets and across various openings, like seaweed over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>the rocks and sand of the seashore, the railings and grilles are full of intense organic
vitality with none of the graceful droopiness of Guimard’s Métro entrances. Gaudí’s
metalwork frequently suggests the work of various mid-twentieth-century sculptors in
welded metal, quite as his handling of masonry does later sculpture in stone. Indeed, his
iron grilles often exceed such sculptors’ metalwork in richness and variety of form, as also
in the fine hand-craftsmanship of the execution.</p>

<p class='c010'>The detailing on the Casa Milá, whether of the masonry or the ironwork, avoids the
nightmarish overscaling of the somewhat similar elements at the Parc Güell, and also the
coarseness of the broken faience mosaic surfaces that he used so much there and elsewhere
but here restricted to the roof-tops. As regards the masonry, moreover, it is really
wrong to speak of detailing, for the very fabric of the structure, not just its edges and its
trimmings as on the Casa Batlló, has been completely moulded to the architect’s plastic
will. Whether or not it be correct to consider the Casa Milá an example of the Art
Nouveau—and technically it is not—La Pedrera remains one of the greatest masterpieces
of the curvilinear mode of 1900, rivalled in quality only by the finest of Sullivan’s
skyscrapers (Plate <a href='#pl119'>119</a>), which it does not, of course, resemble visually at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the esteem in which his work has always been held by his fellow-citizens of
Barcelona, Gaudí had few local imitators of consequence. However, such detailing on
early twentieth-century buildings there as may appear at first to be conventionally Art
Nouveau is often in fact a bit Gaudian. Only his assistants Francisc Berenguer (1866-1914)
and J. M. Jujol Gibert (1879-1949) seem to have understood Gaudí’s mature style.
At least the house by Jujol at 335 Diagonal in Barcelona, though quite small and simple,
and the Bodega Güell at Garraf of 1913 by Berenguer are of a quality worthy of comparison
with Gaudí’s own best work.<a id="r393"></a><a href='#f393' class='c025'><sup>[393]</sup></a> The big Palau de la Musica Catalana, built by
Luis Domenech Montaner (1850-1923) in 1908, is a very extravagant example of the
architecture of the period, bold and coarse and rich, but with none of Gaudí’s personal
flair and integrity.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Glasgow Mackintosh after 1908 was a prophet with far less honour than ‘Greek’
Thomson had received there in an earlier day. But the countercurrent that he had
helped to set going on the Continent was in full swing, particularly in Austria and in
Germany (see Chapters <a href='#ch20'>20</a> and <a href='#ch21'>21</a>). Even in Horta’s own Brussels, Josef Hoffmann had
been called from Vienna as early as 1905 to build the suburban Stoclet
mansion (Plate <a href='#pl154a'>154<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) at 373 Avenue de Tervueren (see Chapter <a href='#ch21'>21</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the ephemeral nature of much of its production and the completeness with
which it was ultimately rejected everywhere, the Art Nouveau has very great historical
importance. The Art Nouveau offered the first international programme for a basic renewal
of architecture that the nineteenth century actually set out to realize. Most earlier
programmes, moreover, even if not primarily revivalistic, aimed chiefly at the reform
of architecture; this was still true of Voysey and his English contemporaries in these
very years, though not, of course, of Sullivan and Wright, working in isolation in the
American Middle West. Thus the Art Nouveau was actually the first stage of modern
architecture in Europe, if modern architecture be understood as implying, before
anything else, the total rejection of historicism.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>The proto-modernity of earlier stages of nineteenth-century architectural development
is almost always ambiguous, since the leaders of the various successive movements
rarely intended to break with the past entirely. The characteristic ideal of
nineteenth-century architects, as of their late eighteenth-century predecessors, had been
to react against what they considered the decadence of the building arts current in their day
by returning to the principles of some earlier and supposedly purer or more vital age.
The very considerable amount of innovation that many European architects before
Horta introduced in their work was not exactly unconscious; but it was rather a matter
of achieving personal expression by adapting old forms to new needs, new materials,
and new methods of construction than of creating a wholly original modern style.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well before the nineties a very few men had consciously sought absolute originality
and total freedom from the disciplines of the past. But such architects found little or no
public support for their programmes of architectural revolution nor even fellow-artists
to share in their highly individualistic campaigns. After the relatively universal acceptance
of the doctrines of Romantic Classicism there had followed chiefly a succession and
a multiplication of divergences; now, in the nineties, a real pattern of convergence
appeared. But this convergence was premature. The renewal of ornament and of the
accessories of architecture outran the renewal of the more basic elements of the art of
building towards which the technical developments of the nineteenth century had been
so inevitably leading.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus the Art Nouveau stands apart both from the architecture of the preceding hundred
years and from the modern architecture of the following sixty which extends down
to the present. It did not bring the one to an end, as the profusion of so-called ‘traditional’
buildings of the early twentieth century makes very evident (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>),
nor did it provide much more than a preface to the major new developments that mark
the early decades of the present century (see Chapters <a href='#ch18'>18</a>-<a href='#ch21'>21</a>). That the Art Nouveau
was completely rejected on principle by ‘traditionalists’ is not surprising: it was the first
serious attack on the position they continued to maintain. But the very rapidity with
which the Art Nouveau rose to popularity and descended to vulgarization encouraged
its denigration in the name of ‘taste’ by almost all other architects soon after it reached
its climax around 1900. In recompense, interest in the Art Nouveau began to revive
early, by the early thirties, after a much shorter period of neglect than other phases of
nineteenth-century architectural development have undergone and are still undergoing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The place of the Art Nouveau in the story of modern architecture, if only as an
episode of youthful wild-oat-sowing, is now well established. Most of its exponents
actually lived long enough to receive in their later years embarrassing praise for youthful
work they had quite disowned if not forgotten. It is a curious paradox that although
most of the leaders of the Art Nouveau survived for decades—and Van de Velde died
only in 1957—not one except Gaudí<a id="r394"></a><a href='#f394' class='c025'><sup>[394]</sup></a> maintained after 1910 the position of relative pre-eminence
that had been his in 1900. A wholly new cast of characters, many of them no
younger, came to the fore in the first decade of the twentieth century; they constitute
the first generation of modern architects, properly speaking.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>No</span> better name than ‘modern’ has yet been found for what has come to be the characteristic
architecture of the twentieth century throughout the western world, well beyond
its confines also in Japan, India, and Africa, and increasingly in most of the Communist
countries. Alternative adjectives such as ‘rational’, ‘functional’, ‘international’, or
‘organic’ all have the disadvantage of being either vaguer or more tendentious. Whether
the Art Nouveau or such things as Sullivan’s skyscrapers and Voysey’s houses all truly
belong, in their rather sharply differing ways, to a first stage of modern architecture
or are transitional and prefatory may still be debated; but from the earliest years of this
century several continuous lines of development can certainly be traced. These lines
were in the main convergent through the twenties, if increasingly divergent in the middle
decades of the century. By stressing generic changes rather than specific achievements
the development can be presented almost anonymously, somewhat as the nineteenth-century
development of commercial architecture was outlined earlier in this book (see
Chapter <a href='#ch14'>14</a>). But it is more humanistic, and at least as true to the detailed facts, to consider
modern architecture as deriving from the individual activities of a few leaders rather
than from some Hegelian historic necessity. Of those leaders one group, born in the late
1860s, constitutes the first generation; a group born some twenty years later forms a
second generation; since the 1930s still another generation has come to the fore.</p>
<p class='c010'>A somewhat similar succession of three generations could be distinguished in the case
of Romantic Classicism, the last universal style in architecture. What sets the twentieth-century
situation apart from that of the earlier period has been the marked prolongation
of the activity of the first generation, two of whose leading members, Wright and Perret,
lived on and remained active well beyond 1950. Wright continued in vigorous production
down to his death in 1959. The leaders of the second generation, who first moved
towards the centre of the stage in the early twenties, are mostly still alive; two of them
at least, Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, have been rather more productive since
1946 than they were earlier in their careers (see Chapter <a href='#ch21'>21</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>While some influence from their juniors can be noted in the later work of the modern
architects of the first generation, a real difference between their approach to architecture
and that of the second generation has continued. Those who have come forward
since the mid thirties owe much to the first generation as well as to the second, yet they
have also manifested some significant characteristics that are their own. The modern
architecture of the last sixty years may well be presented historically in terms of the
work of two generations of leaders (see Chapters <a href='#ch18'>18</a>-<a href='#ch23'>23</a>), and then of the production of
the decade following the Second World War (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>). But modern architecture,
even very broadly interpreted, includes only a small fraction of all building production
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>down to the war; the work of those supporters of the ‘tradition’ in the twentieth
century bulked much larger in quantity, even if it very rarely rivalled the modern
work in interest or quality (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>). An <a href='#epi'>Epilogue</a> will touch on the current
scene in the early sixties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The leaders of the first generation of modern architects remained great individualists
to the last. It is therefore not easy to draw any general stylistic picture from their production,
even for the years before the twenties when they were the only modern architects.
The leaders of the second generation drew their inspiration, in most cases, not
from one but from several of the older men; yet their work was so convergent that by
the mid twenties a body of doctrine had come to exist deriving partly from their theories
and partly from their few executed buildings and their many projects. With the increasingly
wide acceptance of this body of doctrine critics were soon ready to recognize
the existence of a new style as coherent, as consistent, and almost as universally
employed by younger architects everywhere as the Romantic Classical style had been at
the opening of the nineteenth century (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Towards the constitution of this new style each of the great architects of the first
generation had made notable contributions; yet their executed work, and even more
their theories, remained independent of it. To appreciate that work only in the light of
what they had in common with their juniors is to miss much of the richness and all of the
idiosyncrasy of their achievement. In considering the work of these older architects for
its own sake, what sets it apart from the Art Nouveau, whose protagonists were in many
cases their exact contemporaries, must first be indicated and evaluated. For example,
their rejection of ornament, at most but relative, provides only a minor and negative
point of differentiation. In their positive preoccupation with structure and its direct
architectonic expression, and also their reform and revitalization of planning concepts,
however, they went much further than most of the Art Nouveau designers of 1900. It is
true that such architects as Horta and Jourdain, when working with metal and glass, were
concerned with the expression of structure, but that expression was usually more decorative
than architectonic (<a href='#pl132b'>Plates 132<span class='fss'>B</span></a> and <a href='#pl133'>133</a>).
Traditional materials, such as stone and brick, in the hands of Art
Nouveau architects and their spiritual brothers often lost all their
natural character, being treated like so much clay. The sense of
materials, both new and old, and the determination of their proper use
preoccupied all the leading architects of the first generation,
something for which only the English and the Americans prepared the
way in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new importance of structure and its expression, the preoccupation with a particular
building material, is nowhere more evident than in the work of Auguste Perret
(1874-1954), the only great French architect of this generation. Associated as he was
with the family contracting firm of A. &amp; G. Perret, which specialized early in the use of
reinforced concrete, he saw as his principal task the development of formulas of
design for concrete as valid as those so long established in France for building with stone.
The other architects of his generation came more gradually and less whole-heartedly to
the exploitation of new materials—it is paradoxical, for example, that the characteristic
Art Nouveau interest in exposed metal construction came generally to an end about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>1905—and their work as a result is more various and less doctrinaire. Because of Perret’s
clear definition of his goal and his single-minded advance along a predetermined line,
his somewhat limited architectural achievement may well be considered before the protean
many-sidedness of Wright’s in America and the ambiguity of Peter Behrens’s
in Germany, not to speak of the important contributions of Wagner and Loos in Austria,
and of Berlage and de Klerk in Holland (see Chapters <a href='#ch19'>19</a>, <a href='#ch20'>20</a>, and <a href='#ch21'>21</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Auguste Perret came of Burgundian stock, but by the accident of his father’s exile
from France after the Commune he was born in Brussels. His education was entirely
French. He left the École des Beaux-Arts to enter the family’s building firm without
waiting to receive the Government’s diploma, somewhat as Wright went out into the
practical world with but two years of engineering school behind him. His career began
almost at once, for he built his first house at Berneval in 1890. Several blocks of flats
and an office building in Paris followed in the next eight years; the Municipal Casino
at St-Malo, built in 1899, was the first work of any real consequence. There he and his
brother Gustave (1876-?) used reinforced concrete for an unsupported slab floor of
54-foot span. Executed otherwise in local granite and wood, this building has a certain
bold simplicity as remote from ‘Beaux-Arts’ as from Art Nouveau work of the period.</p>

<p class='c010'>Reinforced concrete,<a id="r395"></a><a href='#f395' class='c025'><sup>[395]</sup></a> that is concrete strengthened by internal reinforcing rods of
metal, seems to have been invented by a French gardener named Joseph Monnier in
1849, but he used it only for flower pots and outdoor furniture. In 1847 François Coignet
(1814-88) built some houses of poured concrete without reinforcement; in 1852 for
a house at 72 Rue Charles Michel in St-Denis, Seine, Coignet first employed his own
system of <i>béton armé</i>, to use his term. That term has since remained current in French—the
German term is <i>Eisenbeton</i>, the Italian <i>cimento armato</i>. During the next four decades
ferro-concrete, to give it its simplest English name, was developed very gradually by
Coignet and by François Hennebique (1842-1921) with no very notable architectural
results. Detailed research is gradually revealing many instances of its early use by various
men in different countries; but neither in the scale of its employment nor in the achievement
of new and characteristic modes of expression does its history in these decades rival
that of iron in the first half of the nineteenth century (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1894, just as the Art Nouveau was reaching France, ferro-concrete was used for the
first time in a structure of some modest architectural pretension by J.-E.-A. de Baudot<a id="r396"></a><a href='#f396' class='c025'><sup>[396]</sup></a>
(1836-1915) for a school in the Rue de Sévigné in Paris. This is overshadowed in interest,
however, by the church he began to build in 1897. Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre at 2
Place des Abbesses in Paris has very little connexion with the Art Nouveau except for
its drastic novelty. On the contrary, de Baudot employed for his structural skeleton very
much simplified Gothic forms. Actually, it is incorrect to call the material used here
<i>béton armé</i>; it is more properly <i>ciment armé</i> since there is no coarse aggregate as in
concrete. Like his master Viollet-le-Duc’s projects, Saint-Jean is curious rather than impressive
and not at all to be compared in intrinsic interest with Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia.
Worth noting, however, is the use of faience mosaic to decorate the concrete structural
members, something de Baudot had already tried out on his earlier school. The authorities
were dubious of the strength of de Baudot’s structure, as well they might have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>considering the iron-like delicacy of the membering, and a hiatus of several years held
up the construction after 1899, the church being completed only in 1902-4. As has been
mentioned already, the contractor was Contamin working with Soubaux, his partner
of the period.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre was finally finished in 1904, Perret had already
demonstrated the architectural possibilities of the new material rather more effectively
in the block of flats that he built in 1902-3 at 25 bis Rue Franklin in Paris. Despite the
echo of the Art Nouveau already noted in the foliage patterns of faience mosaic filling
the wall-panels on the exterior, most of the interest of the building resides in its structure
and its planning. Like that of Anatole de Baudot’s church, the structure is visibly a
discrete framework, but made up entirely of vertical and horizontal elements with no
curved members of either Gothic or Art Nouveau inspiration. However, the concrete
is nowhere exposed but always covered with glazed tile sheathing. Within the wall-panels
the windows are crisply outlined by plain projecting bands of tile; this provides
an early instance of that <i>encadrement</i>, or framing, on which Perret came to insist in all
his work after the mid twenties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The skeletal structure of 25 bis Rue Franklin allowed great freedom in planning
(Figure <a href='#i311'>36</a>). Around a small court, sunk into the front of the building, the principal
living areas of each flat all open into one another, somewhat as in Wright’s Hickox
house of 1900 but with less spatial unification (Figure <a href='#i274'>31</a>); the result is closer to Horta’s
treatment of the main floor of his Aubecq house of 1900 in Brussels (Figure <a href='#i290'>34</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The next year Perret built another block of flats at 83 Avenue Niel in Paris with an
internal skeleton not of concrete but of metal, and façades of stone treated somewhat like
those of his Art Nouveau flats of the previous year in the Avenue Wagram (see Chapter
17). He returned, however, at once to the use of ferro-concrete and rarely deserted it
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Garage Ponthieu, which was built in 1905-6 in the Rue de Ponthieu
in Paris, is a much more striking example of the possibilities of the
new material than the earlier blocks of flats; moreover, the concrete
is here exposed (Plate <a href='#pl139a'>139<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Inside, galleries
carried along both sides of the
<span class="sans">L</span>-shaped
space provide a second level for parking motor
cars and the whole interior is almost as light and open as if it were built of metal, thus
recalling a little de Baudot’s church. The façade, likewise, is as skeletal as if executed with
a metal frame. But Perret’s determination, somewhat comparable to Sullivan’s in the
Wainwright Building in St Louis of fifteen years before, to organize the expression
of a new type of construction along basically Classical lines is as evident as the maximal
fenestration. The thin slab which projects at the top provides a sort of cornice and the range
of small windows underneath it a sort of frieze, while the arrangement of the elements of
the façade below is very formal indeed. The rose-window-like glazing of the big central
panel is somewhat rudimentary and rather less Classical in feeling than the rest, but the
essentials of Perret’s concrete aesthetic are all adumbrated here as they were not in the
more tentative block of flats in the Rue Franklin.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the solid, marble-sheathed façade of the Théâtre des Champs Élysées in the Avenue
Montaigne in Paris, Perret’s largest and most conspicuous early work, his classicizing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>intentions are even more evident, but the expression of concrete-skeleton structure is
much less complete; these intentions are underlined, moreover, by the large stylized
reliefs by Antoine Bourdelle that provide the only external decoration. Originally, in
late 1910, the commission for this theatre was given to Van de Velde. He at once proposed
that it should be built of ferro-concrete with the Perret firm as contractors. During
the course of the following year Perret proposed various changes in the plan to make
more practical its construction with a concrete skeleton. When he later offered an
alternative design for the façade this was preferred by Van de Velde because it seemed
then so expressive of the underlying structure, as it hardly does to posterity. By September
Van de Velde made a final report as consulting architect and withdrew completely.
Needless to say, there has been controversy ever since as to the degree of Perret’s responsibility
for this major monument of twentieth-century Paris; as built, however,
there can be little question that it is very largely of his design. How different a theatre
by Van de Velde would have been is at least suggested by the one that he erected in 1914
for the Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne (see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The foyer of the Théâtre des Champs Élysées expresses the possibilities of ferro-concrete
in a more architectural way than do the interiors of the earlier block of flats and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>the garage. The actual structural members of the skeleton are visible in the free-standing
columns, as are also the beams that they support; the walls are very evidently only thin
panels between the piers. A few simple mouldings are used to assimilate the new expression
to the conventions of academic design—too few to satisfy contemporaries, though
too many for later taste.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is less clarity of expression in the great auditorium because of the profusion of
murals contributed by various Symbolists and Neo-Impressionists—Maurice Denis and
K.-X. Roussel most notably—and by the over-all gilding of the principal structural members,
which are also elaborated by semi-Classical detailing. Even so, the fact that the
dome is carried on the four pairs of tall slender columns is very evident, and the swinging
curves of the successive balconies give early evidence of the ease with which ferro-concrete
lends itself to bold cantilevering.</p>

<p class='c010'>The presumed necessity of achieving monumentality undoubtedly compromised the
purity of Perret’s expression of structure throughout the Théâtre des Champs Élysées.
During the War, which followed so soon after the inauguration of the theatre in 1913,
an important industrial commission of Perret’s produced what would be for the next
generation of architects a more exemplary work. The warehouses built at Casablanca
in North Africa in 1915-16—there are also others there of 1919—required no representational
display; they are almost ‘pure’ engineering in concrete. But the lightness of
their walls, pierced with abstract patterns formed by ventilating holes, and the elegance
of their thin shell vaults of segmental section displayed the potentialities of a quite new
structural aesthetic, at once delicate and precise, with no echoes at all of the massive
masonry buildings of the past.</p>

<p class='c010'>The interior of the Esders Clothing Factory at 78 Avenue Philippe-Auguste in Paris,
erected just after the War in 1919, and several smaller industrial buildings for the metal-working
firm of Wallut &amp; Grange at Montataire, Oise, of 1919-21 were more readily
studied by younger architects and, in the case of the Esders factory, much grander in
scale than the North African warehouses. Even more elegant than the warehouses, and
equally ‘pure’, was the atelier of the decorator Durand built in Paris in the Rue Olivier-Métra
in 1922. This has a shell vault rising from the floor broken, along one side only, by
a long skylight over widely spaced ribs that continue the curve of the vault.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time, of course, ferro-concrete was in general use for industrial building
throughout most of the western world. In France the vast parabolic-vaulted aircraft
hangar at Orly, Seine, designed by the engineer Eugène Freyssinet (1879-1962) in 1916,
overshadowed in size and boldness anything built by Perret. This very exceptional utilitarian
construction, magnificent in form yet quite without architectural pretension,
was destroyed during the Second World War. To Tony Garnier’s work in Lyons we
shall turn later.</p>

<p class='c010'>In America Frank Lloyd Wright used ferro-concrete for his modest E.Z. Polish
Factory in Chicago in 1905, just as Ernest L. Ransome was completing the first mature
example of a large plant of ferro-concrete frame construction, the United Shoe
Machinery Plant in Beverly, Mass., begun in 1903.<a id="r397"></a><a href='#f397' class='c025'><sup>[397]</sup></a> All over the Middle West, moreover,
grain elevators<a id="r398"></a><a href='#f398' class='c025'><sup>[398]</sup></a> were rising in the form of gigantic linked cylinders. In Switzerland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the great engineer Robert Maillart (1872-1940) in his factories and bridges was
using concrete in several new ways as different from the elevators as from the usual
timber-like frames of the French and the Americans or the shell vaults of Perret and
Freyssinet. Everywhere the importance of ferro-concrete as the prime building material
of the twentieth century was receiving increasing recognition; for it was a material more
universally available than structural steel and also so elastic in its potentialities that these
have hardly even yet been adequately explored.<a id="r399"></a><a href='#f399' class='c025'><sup>[399]</sup></a> In the early twenties, when a younger
generation of architects all over Europe turned their major attention to ferro-concrete as
the most modern of building materials, Perret was the architect who had the most to
offer them—how limited had been Wright’s exploitation of concrete up to this time we
shall shortly see (see Chapter <a href='#ch19'>19</a>). When Perret erected the church of Notre-Dame at Le
Raincy, S.-et-O., near Paris in 1922-3 concrete came of age as a building material in
somewhat the same way that cast iron had done in a series of major English and French
edifices of the 1840s (see Chapter <a href='#ch07'>7</a>).</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 37. Auguste Perret: Le Raincy, S.-et-O., Notre-Dame, 1922-3, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Le Raincy church is not revolutionary in plan, being a basilica with aisles and an
apse; unlike de Baudot’s church, however, it has no specific elements of Gothic reminiscence
in the interior (Plate <a href='#pl141'>141</a>). Instead it provides what the medieval builders
of Saint-Urbain at Troyes or King’s College Chapel in Cambridge had obviously
sought to achieve, a complete cage of glass supported by a minimal skeleton of solid
elements. The broad segmental shell vault of the nave, with smaller vaults running
crosswise over the aisle bays in the Cistercian way, is carried on no walls at all but only
on the slightest of free-standing columns reeded vertically by the forms in which they
were cast (Figure <a href='#i313'>37</a>). Quite separate from this supporting skeleton is the continuous
enclosing screen of pre-cast concrete units, pierced and filled with coloured glass designed
by Maurice Denis. This is carried round the entire rectangle of interior space and
bowed out at the east end in a segmental curve to form a shallow apse behind the altar.
Only at the front is the clarity of the conception compromised by the awkward impingement
of the clusters of columns that shoot up to form the tower.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Deserting the dilute Classicism that was his natural bent, Perret allowed the clustered
piers of his tower to rise into the sky, supporting nothing at the top, in order to approximate
the outline of a Gothic spire. Even more than in the interior, where one is aware only
of the lowest stage, the verticalism and the medieval suggestion of this feature, so over-ingeniously
composed of standard ferro-concrete elements, seems quite at odds with the
severe concrete-and-glass box that provides the body of the church. Few other ferro-concrete
churches<a id="r400"></a><a href='#f400' class='c025'><sup>[400]</sup></a> of the twenties, least of all Perret’s own Sainte-Thérèse at Montmagny,
S.-et-O., of 1925-6 and other French ones by his imitators, rival Notre-Dame at Le
Raincy. The largest and boldest, Sankt Antonius at Basel in Switzerland, built by Karl
Moser (1860-1936) in 1926-7, seems somewhat heavy and factory-like. Its plain rectangular
tower, however, rising free at one corner of the church, is much simpler and more
original than Perret’s spire and has been frequently and successfully emulated by other
architects. Of quite a different order are the Expressionist churches of the German
Dominikus Böhm, which have, in the long run, had at least as wide an influence (see
Chapters 20 and 25).</p>

<p class='c010'>Two remodelled Paris banks, one of 1922 for the Société Marseillaise de Crédit in
the Rue Auber and another of 1925 for the Crédit National Hôtelier, gave evidence of
Perret’s capacity to extend the implications of ferro-concrete design to more conventional
problems. These interiors are almost wholly devoid of ornament, and they largely
depend for their effectiveness, like the foyer of the Théâtre des Champs Élysées, upon
the careful proportioning of the exposed elements of the skeleton construction. In 1924
the Palais de Bois, a temporary exhibition building at the Porte Maillot in Paris, showed
how this sense of direct structural expression could be exploited in a building all of
timber. This was much more successful than the theatre that Perret built in 1924-5 for
the Paris Exposition des Arts Décoratifs. Of a quite different order was the Tour
d’Orientation at Grenoble, also of 1924-5. Here Perret was far happier in achieving
something comparable to the richness of medieval spires with standard structural
elements and pre-cast panels than in the tower of his church at Le Raincy, for this is much
more structurally conceived and quite devoid of Gothic reminiscence in the outline.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mid twenties also brought to Perret, by this time widely recognized in advanced
circles as the leading French architect, several commissions for houses, chiefly for
artists, in France and even as far afield as Egypt. Characteristically French in his preoccupation
with large, not to say monumental, problems, house-design was not Perret’s
forte in the way it was that of his American and Austrian contemporaries Wright and
Loos. Moreover by this date certain younger architects, particularly Le Corbusier and
two or three others in Paris, had set under way a revolution in domestic architecture as
drastic as Wright’s of twenty-five years earlier (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Perret’s best houses, such as the Mouron house at Versailles of 1926 or the Nubar
house in the Rue du 19 Janvier at Garches of 1930, have an almost eighteenth-century
dignity and serenity. The ‘stripped-Classical’ apparatus of terminal cornices, <i>encadrements</i>
around the openings, and occasional free-standing columns is doubtless logical as
an expression of the construction, but it is also very conservative in effect. Yet the ferro-concrete
construction encouraged Perret to introduce very wide openings leading out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>on to surrounding terraces and to open up the main living areas even more than he had
done in the flats of 1902-3 in the Rue Franklin. Such treatments were still rather advanced
for Europe, however common they may have been in America for a quarter of a century
and more. The characteristic quality of Perret’s domestic work is seen at its best in a
small block of flats at 9 Place de la Porte de Passy in Paris facing the Bois de Boulogne
that he built in 1930 (Plate <a href='#pl139b'>139<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This has a façade towards the park so superbly proportioned
that it might almost be by Schinkel and a flow of space inside the individual flats
that is worthy of Wright, although much more formal in organization.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now Perret began to receive the official commissions that are generally given in
France only to men well on in years. The building designed in 1929 that he erected for
the technical services of the Ministry of Marine in the Boulevard Victor in Paris is one
of the largest and most typical of his later works (Plate <a href='#pl140b'>140<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The complex rhythms and
subtle three-dimensional play of this façade are entirely produced by the actual structural
elements. The skeleton divides the long façades into a series of horizontal panels within
which are set the vertical frames of the windows separated by pre-cast slabs; in one
storey the windows even extend the full width of the bays.</p>

<p class='c010'>To a considerable extent Perret had succeeded in achieving what he had long consciously
sought, that is, a vocabulary of design in concrete as direct, as expressive, and
as ordered as the masonry vocabulary of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—a
<i>style Louis XX</i>, so to say—still very French in a quite traditional way, yet unmistakably
of this century. In the Garde Meuble or National Furniture Storehouse in the Rue
Croulebarbe in Paris, begun the next year, the vocabulary is—from principle—all but
identical; yet fewer windows and more solid panels were necessary here so that the
general effect is flatter and blanker. The curved colonnade across the open side of the
court is almost archaeologically reminiscent of the eighteenth century, despite the
breadth of its spans and the ingenuity of its detailing. The small concert hall of 1929 in
the Rue Cardinet for the École Normale de Musique is less pretentious but also less
impressive.</p>

<p class='c010'>Concrete to Perret, after all these years of employing it, was not a crude or a substitute
material. By the use of coloured aggregates which he found various means of
exposing he was able to vary the texture and colour of his poured and pre-cast elements
with considerable subtlety and elegance. In the later buildings the workmanship is
usually of the highest quality—it was by no means so in the early twenties—with arrises
brought to a sharp edge in pure cement and such classicizing details as the flute-like
facets on piers and the capital-like treatment of their tops carried to a finish comparable
to that of chisel-cut freestone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus Perret was eventually able to avoid the industrial brutality of much work in
concrete where the material is left as it comes from rough timber forms with crumbling
arrises and pockmarked surfaces. Such lack of finish is acceptable in large-scale engineering
work but certainly awkward when seen close to as in Notre-Dame at Le Raincy. On
the other hand, Perret kept well away also from that slickness of surface—especially popular
with younger architects in the twenties—that is produced when concrete is covered
with a smooth stucco rendering and painted.<a id="r401"></a><a href='#f401' class='c025'><sup>[401]</sup></a> Such slickness is, of course, generally very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>soon lost as the original surface grows cracked and stained; only too rarely is it properly
maintained by frequent patching and repainting. Concrete was to Perret a worthy
material, like stone, and therefore deserved the effort and the cost required to give it an
expressive finish requiring little or no maintenance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reticulated wall system of the big government buildings was also used for a
block of flats at 51-55 Rue Raynouard, built in 1932, where Perret himself lived and also
maintained his atelier. The necessary adaptation of his formalized open planning to a
trapezoidal site produced suites of interior space of considerable complexity yet perfect
orderliness. Though Perret was still without a governmental diploma, the atelier<a id="r402"></a><a href='#f402' class='c025'><sup>[402]</sup></a> he
ran here was associated with the École des Beaux-Arts. It almost seemed now as if he
wished to demonstrate how much truer a representative he was of real French tradition
than those who were its official, though unworthy, custodians. Thus the older he grew
the farther his work drew away from that of the more revolutionary modern architects
of the second generation. By 1930 it had definitely begun to date; yet it was only in the
last twenty-five years of his life that there came to him the greatest opportunities of
realizing his ambitions for French twentieth-century architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>In comparison with Perret’s own pioneering of 1902-22 his late work seems to lack
vitality. For all the thought that went into its finish, for all the virtuosity of certain
features—such as the self-supporting curve of the broad stair that spirals down into his
atelier in the Rue Raynouard—his very ambition to create a new French tradition gave
his later buildings something of the banality of those designed by the more conventionally
‘traditional’ architects of his generation. This applies in particular to his principal
work of the thirties in Paris, the still unfinished Musée des Travaux-Publics in the
Avenue du Président-Wilson which he began in 1937. Here the ingeniously pseudo-Classical—yet
also truly structural—apparatus of external engaged columns and the intricate
plan spreading out from a circular auditorium at the apex of the site are quite in
the Beaux-Arts manner. But the grandeur of scale in the interiors and the exciting upward
sweep of the boldly curving stairs lend value, and even novelty, to a scheme that is
in many ways extremely conservative.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the Second World War Perret was asked to provide plans for the rebuilding of
several bombed cities: Le Havre in 1945; Amiens in 1947; and the Vieux-Port district of
Marseilles in 1951. For Amiens he designed a skyscraper, long physically complete but still
unoccupied, that derives more from his decorative Tour d’Orientation at Grenoble than
from the skyscrapers of the New World. This is one of his few complete failures, if for
no other reason than the competition its tall and awkward silhouette offers to the
cathedral, whose towers had so long dominated the city’s skyline. The executed Marseilles
buildings are not of his design any more than are most of those at Amiens.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Le Havre, however, his control of the rebuilding was more complete. The Place de
l’Hôtel de Ville, or at least the three sides completed between 1948 and 1950 by his
associates, outweighs by a great deal the failure of the Amiens skyscraper (Plate <a href='#pl140a'>140<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
Ranges of four-storey buildings, all carried out in the reticulated vocabulary of his
Government buildings of the early thirties in Paris, surround a large sunken plaza; the
Hôtel de Ville in the near-Beaux-Arts manner of his Musée des Travaux Publics occupies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>the fourth side. Shops open towards the square under a continuous colonnade. Behind,
rising out of small courts, are taller towers occupied by flats; these lend great three-dimensional
interest to the formal and absolutely symmetrical layout of this section of
the rebuilt quarter. Since his death similar ranges of buildings have been carried out
along the quais to the south. On the whole the extensive work of the team<a id="r403"></a><a href='#f403' class='c025'><sup>[403]</sup></a> is superior
to the public monuments by their captain, the Hôtel de Ville and the church of St
Joseph, both designed in 1950 and completed before Perret’s death in 1954.</p>

<p class='c010'>Impressive as is Perret’s Le Havre in the international roster of post-war urban
rebuilding, it seems curiously out of date today, a mere realization in the 1940s and
1950s, one might almost say, of the aspirations of the early decades of the century. Since
that period had few such opportunities as was Perret’s here to realize urbanism on this
scale, however, what he accomplished there is a welcome addition to the city-building
achievements of this century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Until the second generation appeared on the scene in the twenties France produced
little modern architecture of much interest besides Perret’s work. The department stores
of the early years of the century, still strongly under the influence of the Art Nouveau,
have already been mentioned (see Chapter <a href='#ch17'>17</a>). After Perret the most important architect
was Tony Garnier (1867-1948), and he is of more significance for a vast project that
he prepared in his youth than for the executed work of his maturity. In the later decades
of the eighteenth century, when the Romantic Classical revolution in architecture was
getting under way, projects were often of more interest than executed buildings for
their premonitions of what was to come, and this was particularly true in France. It was
true again in the early decades of the twentieth century, down at least to Le Corbusier’s
project for the Palace of the League of Nations of 1927-8.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ledoux’s ‘Ville Idéale’ summarized his own aspirations and also provided a wealth of
ideas from which later generations of Romantic Classical architects could draw inspiration.
So, at the opening of the twentieth century, Garnier’s very complete scheme
for a ‘Cité Industrielle’<a id="r404"></a><a href='#f404' class='c025'><sup>[404]</sup></a> contained a wealth of ideas on which architects drew well into
the 1920s. Like that of the ‘Ville Idéale’, the interest of the ‘Cité Industrielle’ is threefold:
sociological, urbanistic, and architectural. Henceforth the industrial city would be
more and more accepted as normal and not exceptional. Its needs both general and
specific—so notably recognized by Garnier, all the way from the provision of adequate
workers’ housing to various sorts of industrial plants—would become more and more
important preoccupations of most modern architects. In coping generally with the
manifold needs of an industrial community Garnier also faced in detail many very
different individual architectural problems with considerable ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnier’s solutions in the main were very simple and direct, but they often had a
merely negative character, as of buildings of academic design scraped of all surface paraphernalia,
rather than displaying any fresh and creative approach. But an important part
of the main architectural development for some twenty years was to be such a purging
of inherited excess. Garnier reduced architecture to basic, if not particularly unfamiliar,
terms; on his foundations the next generation began, in the twenties, to build something
much more positive; thus his influence was parallel to that of Loos
(see Chapters <a href='#ch20'>20</a> and <a href='#ch21'>21</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>His contribution to the twentieth century’s repertory of forms was less than
Ledoux’s had been to that of the nineteenth a hundred years earlier; notably inferior
in quality to Ledoux’s was his own actual production, moreover.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnier’s appointment as Architect of the City of Lyons in 1905, a position which he
retained until 1919, might seem to have provided the perfect opportunity to realize his
dreams as, but for the Revolution, should Ledoux’s appointment by Louis XV to build
the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans. But neither the Municipal Slaughterhouse of
Lyons at La Mouche, executed in 1909-13, the Herriot Hospital at Grange-Blanche,
designed in 1911 and begun in 1915, nor the Olympic Stadium of 1913-16 at Lyons
realize much more than the obvious practical implications of the detailed projects for
various buildings in his ‘Cité Industrielle’.<a id="r405"></a><a href='#f405' class='c025'><sup>[405]</sup></a> The slaughterhouse is bold structurally but
clumsily industrial in its handling, with none of the refinement of Perret’s factories; the
more highly finished stadium has irrelevant Classical touches in the detailing, simple
though it is, of the concrete elements.</p>

<p class='c010'>Garnier’s work after the First World War began with the hospital, which was completed
only in 1930, and included a large low-cost housing project in the États-Unis
quarter of Lyons designed as early as 1920 but executed only in 1928-30. Both are quite
overshadowed by the comparable work of the next generation in these years—that in
other countries at least, if not that in France. The Moncey Telephone Office at Lyons of
1927, the Textile School at La Croix-Rousse of 1930, and the Hôtel de Ville of the Paris
suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt of 1931-4, on which another architect, J.-H.-E. Debat-Ponsan
(b. 1882), a pupil of Victor Laloux, collaborated, differ very little from the
scraped academicism of most French public architecture of this period. The houses Garnier
built in 1909 at St-Rambert and in 1910 at St-Cyr (Mont d’Or) are among his best
executed works; all the same, except for their early date, they are hardly very notable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two blocks of flats built by Henri Sauvage (1873-1932) in 1925 in the Rue des
Amiraux and in the Rue Vavin in Paris, faced with glazed white brick and stepped back
in section to provide terraces for the upper floors, are well above the level of quality
of Garnier’s later work without approaching that of Perret’s. That in the Rue des
Amiraux, being for working-class occupancy, is more significant of the international
aspirations of the period. Although less drastically novel than the low-cost housing of
the twenties in Holland and Germany, this has survived very well because of its permanent
grime-proof surfacing. It has been rather unjustly forgotten, largely because it
lies off the main line of international development (see Chapter <a href='#ch21'>21</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Most French production in the twenties remained completely subject to academic
discipline although it was often tricked out with the sort of modish decoration that
flourished particularly at the Paris Exposition des Arts Décoratifs of 1925. Yet at the
same time Paris, as the world capital of modern art, was one of the three great foci of
architectural advance. The linkage between advanced painting and the Art Nouveau in
the nineties was discussed earlier (see Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a>). Perret employed Symbolist and Neo-Impressionist
painters as collaborators, beginning with the Théâtre des Champs Élysées
before the First World War. But there is no real parallel between his architecture and
that of Garnier or Sauvage on the one hand and the art of the great twentieth-century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>masters of the École de Paris on the other. Picasso, Gris, Braque, Matisse, and Derain
had no effective influence on architecture. Characteristically Perret employed Bourdelle,
not Maillol, when he needed sculpture. With the next generation the situation entirely
changed; but the new architects of the twenties, not only in France but everywhere, for
all their greater sophistication and their close association with advanced painters and
sculptors, still owed at least as much to Perret and to Garnier if not to Sauvage.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the most creative new architects who appeared around 1920 Garnier’s project for
the ‘Cité Industrielle’ offered both a challenge and an inspiration, but Perret was by far
the more important influence. Somewhat later, towards 1930, that influence became
almost ubiquitous in France, and its effect grew increasingly banal as the ferro-concrete
Classicism of Perret’s later work gradually replaced the official and inherited tradition of
the École des Beaux-Arts, by that time nearly obsolete even in France.<a id="r406"></a><a href='#f406' class='c025'><sup>[406]</sup></a> As has so often
happened in France before, a youthful rebel, after being accepted late in life by the
academic authorities, was only too ready to support a new discipline that had itself
already become academic. Thus is cultural continuity maintained in France at the expense
of variety and recurrent new growth. The situation was rather different in
America, as we shall soon see.</p>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c013'><span class='c027'>CHAPTER 19</span><br />FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AND HIS CALIFORNIA CONTEMPORARIES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Wright</span> in America found himself, in his seventies, as generally accepted a master as
did Perret in France, but his influence never became at all academic in the way of
Perret’s after 1930. There could hardly be a greater contrast between the careers of two
contemporaries in the same field. Both were very productive over a length of time
that is more than a third of the whole period covered by this book, but this is about all
that they did have in common. Perret’s career progressed gradually over several decades
to general and even official acceptance. Wright’s career, on the other hand, had very
notable ups and downs, and he only once received a governmental commission.</p>
<p class='c010'>After the years of preparation discussed earlier (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>) there followed some
ten years of great success. But this success was largely restricted to a particular region,
the Middle West, and to a particular field, the building of good-sized suburban houses.
Following that, in a decade interrupted by the First World War, Wright’s influence
rapidly increased, not at home but abroad, although he had considerably fewer, if much
larger, commissions. Then, paradoxically, in the twenties, while the United States
swung into the biggest building boom in history, there began a decade in which Wright’s
production all but ceased. Many assumed that his career had closed and that his work
had passed into history as had Voysey’s and Mackintosh’s by that time. This, of course,
was not at all true. In the mid thirties Wright’s activity revived, and his production
continued at a rising rate until his death. Moreover, there was little sign of any decline
into personal academicism such as marked the late work of Perret in the same decades.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where Perret had, in effect, only a double architectural career, being largely occupied
on the one hand with industrial commissions close to the dividing line between architecture
and engineering, and on the other hand with public buildings, Wright’s career
was increasingly multifarious. Beginning chiefly as a domestic architect, he never
ceased to build houses; but by the 1950s there were few fields, including that of urbanism,
which he had not entered, if only to present challenging projects and announce controversial
theses. Disciple of a great skyscraper architect, author of a succession of skyscraper
projects, Wright had to wait a full half century after Sullivan completed his last
skyscraper in Chicago before he built his first, the Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma,
in 1953-5. Some of his planning projects may yet come to posthumous execution,
and his work at Florida Southern College at least was of urbanistic scope.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perret consciously summarized and continued earlier French tradition; but Wright
wished to initiate a new tradition, one which he preferred to call ‘Usonian’ rather than
American. Perret’s disciples, emulators, and imitators in his later years were able to take
control of French architecture to a quite considerable extent. Wright’s disciples, despite
the fifty years during which he maintained offices that were also training ateliers in Oak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Park, in Chicago, in Tokyo, in Wisconsin, and in Arizona, have only rarely made any
significant mark of their own; nor has his influence had much more specific effect on the
character of modern architecture in America than it has had generically on that of the
world outside. Where Perret’s influence, particularly outside France, has been largely
restricted to architects working with ferro-concrete, the material that he was the first to
master architecturally—and even in concrete construction this influence has inhibited as
often as it has liberated—Wright’s influence has been protean on the international scene.
From the day when the German publisher Wasmuth first made Wright’s work available
to Europeans at the opening of the second decade of the century this has been true, down
to the time, a decade ago, when the Italian architect, critic, and historian Bruno Zevi
(b. 1918) tried to invert chronology so that Wright’s ‘architettura organica’<a id="r407"></a><a href='#f407' class='c025'><sup>[407]</sup></a> might
seem to succeed rather than to precede the ‘funzionalismo’ or ‘International Style’ of
the second generation of modern architects.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before turning to a more detailed consideration of Wright’s work after 1900 one
further comparison with the <i>œuvre</i> of Perret may be made. Although Wright never
confined himself to one material or to one method of construction—indeed, his versatility
in this respect continued to increase right down to his death—he was from the
first especially interested in the possibilities of concrete. He published in <i>The Brickbuilder</i>
for August 1901 a project for a small village bank, still very Sullivanian in its rich
detailing, that was intended to be executed entirely in concrete. This was only two years
after Perret had first used the material with little or no attempt to develop its architectural
possibilities and a year before his block of flats in the Rue Franklin was designed.
His E.-Z. Polish Factory of 1905 at 3005-17 West Carroll Avenue in Chicago has
already been mentioned. The Unity Church in Oak Park of 1906 (Plate <a href='#pl143b'>143<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), entirely
of concrete surfaced with a special pebble aggregate and decorated with integral ornament,
precedes by many years Perret’s church at Le Raincy (Plate <a href='#pl141'>141</a>). Perret’s ultimate
development of various refined finishes for exposed concrete came still later. Admittedly,
however, the Oak Park church is a much smaller and less striking edifice than Perret’s;
and the work of Kahn and other industrial architects soon overshadowed Wright’s
modest factory. Moreover, it was only with the twenties that Wright, like the
Europeans, really gave major attention to building in concrete.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wright’s creative powers in the first decade of this century were largely concentrated
on his ‘Prairie Houses’. Their essentials were already present in the two Kankakee houses
of 1900 (Plate <a href='#pl142a'>142<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) and the first house designed for the <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> (see Chapter
15). But these essentials received more masterly—one might well say more classic—expression
two years later. The large W. W. Willitts house at 715 South Sheridan Road
in Highland Park, Ill., of 1902 is of wooden-stud construction, but covered like the Kankakee
houses with stucco (Plate <a href='#pl142b'>142<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The C. S. Ross house off the South Shore Road
on Lake Delavan in Wisconsin, also of 1902, has the rough board-and-batten sheathing of
the River Forest Golf Club (<a href='#pl143a'>Plates 143<span class='fss'>A</span></a> and <a href='#pl128b'>128<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
Both offer versions of the cruciform
plan (Figure <a href='#i322'>38</a>) with the interior space ‘flowing’ round a central chimney core and
also extended outward on to covered verandas and open terraces quite as in Price’s
Tuxedo Park houses of fifteen years earlier (Figure <a href='#i270'>28</a>).</p>

<div id='i322'  class='figcenter id003'>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 38. Frank Lloyd Wright: Highland Park, Ill., W. W. Willitts house, 1902, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Another major work of 1902 is the Arthur Heurtley house at 318 Forest
Avenue in Oak Park, Ill. There the principal living areas, which are
on the upper floor as in the Husser house of 1899, form an articulated
<span class="sans">L</span>-shaped
within the basic square that is defined by
the overhanging roof. The brick walls of the lower storey have broad
projecting horizontal bands and the wide, low entrance arch remains
quite Richardsonian. The upper storey consists largely of continuous
ranges of wooden-mullioned casement windows.</p>

<p class='c010'>No notable progression is observable in the series of suburban houses
built during the remainder of this decade before Wright went to Europe
in 1909; but he produced many other brilliant illustrations of both
the cruciform and the square plan as well as a more elongated sort
extending along a single axis. Of the many fine examples of the
Willitts or Ross type around Chicago, the small house for Isabel
Roberts at 603 Edgewood Place in River Forest of 1908 is one of the
best; there the living room in the front wing is carried up two
storeys, as was proposed for one version of the <i>Ladies Home
Journal</i> house. The larger F. J. Baker house at 507 Lake Avenue in
Wilmette of 1909 also has a two-storeyed living room; but here the
tall cross element of the plan which this feature provides was moved
to one end of the house so that the plan is of a
<span class="sans">T</span> or <span class="sans">L</span>
shape rather than cruciform.</p>

<p class='c010'>The E. H. Cheney house at 520 North East Avenue in Oak Park of 1904 is square like
the Heurtley house near by. It is raised off the ground on a sort of extended square stylobate
so that the living area, which runs all across the front as at the Hickox house, can
open freely through french doors on to the walled terrace in front. In the T. P. Hardy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>house at 1319 South Main Street in Racine, Wis., of 1905 a declivitous lakeside site encouraged
a vertical rather than a horizontal organization of the interior with a two-storey
living room as the spatial core.</p>

<p class='c010'>A very different feeling pervades the small, squarish house at 6 Elizabeth Court in
Oak Park that Wright built for Mrs Thomas Gale in 1909. Here flat slabs—which had
been proposed as early as 1902 in a project (perhaps for execution in concrete) for the
Yahara Boat Club in Madison, Wis.—replace the low-pitched hip or gable roofs of the
characteristic Prairie Houses. Moreover, parapeted balconies and other simple rectangular
features elaborate plastically the composition in a fashion that suggests the
abstract sculpture of a decade later in Europe (see Chapter <a href='#ch21'>21</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The W. A. Glasner house of 1905 at 850 Sheridan Road in Glencoe, Ill., on the contrary
was extended longitudinally and the living area for the first time not at all articulated
but completely unified (Figure <a href='#i323'>39</a>). Something of the same longitudinal extension
marks the much larger F. C. Robie house at 5757 Woodlawn Avenue in Chicago of
1909. But there the living room and dining room are separated by the chimney core
and raised above the ground level. Built of fine Roman brick, this is the most monumental
of these early houses. The long horizontal lines of the balcony below and the roof
above dominate the composition; yet a cross element comes forward in the upper storeys
to provide, less symmetrically than in his houses of cruciform plan, something of the
abstract plasticity of the Gale house.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 39. Frank Lloyd Wright: Glencoe, Ill., W. A. Glasner house, 1905, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Another large house of the end of the decade, the Avery Coonley house at 300 Scottswood
Road in Riverside, Ill., of 1908, offers a quite different and much more extended
plan. The square block containing the living room rises above a terrace and a reflecting
pool as the main element of the design, but from this block two long wings project.
That to the left includes a large dining room and also very extensive service facilities at
the rear; in the one to the right are the master’s suite and other bedrooms. Thus the
house is, in a later phrase of Wright’s, ‘zoned’ according to function. The upper walls
of this house are covered with a geometrical pattern produced by setting coloured tiles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>into the stucco. Wright never did quite the same thing again, but this led the way to his
use of patterned concrete blocks a few years later.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two of Wright’s non-domestic works of this period are of considerable importance.
Unity Church in Oak Park has already been mentioned; the other was the Larkin Administration
Building in Buffalo, N.Y., of 1904. Massive and even sculptural externally,
particularly at the ends, this had a tall glass-roofed court running down the centre,
around which the upper ranges of offices extended on galleries carried by somewhat
Sullivanian piers. All the fittings of the offices, including the steel furniture—probably
the first to be designed by an architect—were Wright’s. Thus he set here a wholly new
standard of elegance, consistency, and coherence in semi-industrial building.</p>

<p class='c010'>Within the massive slab-roofed block of the Unity Temple (Plate <a href='#pl143b'>143<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), which is
echoed beyond a low entrance link by the smaller block of the Sunday School, Wright
achieved even more notably than inside the Larkin Building a new sort of monumental
space-composition such as even his biggest houses hardly provided room for. The square
auditorium with incut corners has double galleries on three sides and a pulpit platform
on the fourth, behind which rises the organ. The multiple spatial elements seem to cross
one another at different levels in a sort of three-dimensional plaid. Moreover, this theme
is echoed in all the minor features, such as the wood stripping of the sand-finished
plaster walls and the prominent lighting fixtures. Of this spatial development there had
been some premonition in the auditorium block at one end of the Hillside House School
that he built for his aunts outside Spring Green, Wis., in 1902; but there the masonry of
the exterior walls and piers was still rather Richardsonian and the internal gallery
consisted of a square set lozenge-wise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wright’s work down to 1910 was made available to Europeans by two publications
of Wasmuth, the Berlin publisher; and the end of the first decade of the century does,
coincidentally, mark a real turning point in his career. He would not be so prolific again
before the forties; and henceforth, although he never ceased to build houses, these
would no longer constitute the bulk of his production.</p>

<p class='c010'>The production of the next decade, after his return from Europe in 1911, opens with
two houses, however. Taliesin, which he built outside Spring Green for his mother in
1911, was soon much enlarged when he moved there himself and it always remained
his principal residence. As a result of the growing needs of his family and of his school—not
to speak of two major fires in 1914 and 1925—the Taliesin of today is very different,
above all in its endless ramification, from what he planned in 1911; but the vocabulary
of materials and design stayed more or less constant through all the years. Where the
Prairie Houses echoed in their horizontal lines the flat Illinois terrain on which most
of them were set, Taliesin is wrapped around a hill-top just below the crest. The use of
various levels in the interior and a landscape-like elaboration of the low-pitched roofs
represent his response to this more interesting site; after that the ‘Prairie’ master avoided
flat sites for houses whenever he could!</p>

<p class='c010'>Taliesin, combining a house, drawing-office, living accommodation for apprentices,
and even farm buildings, had from almost the first a complex plan not readily definable
as square, cruciform, or unilinear. But in a project of the same year 1911 in which Taliesin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>was originally built, that for the S. M. Booth house at Glencoe, Ill.—never executed,
unfortunately, according to these plans—a new sort of organization appeared, related to
the elaborated cube of the Gale house and also to the ‘zoned’ scheme of the Coonley
house. A two-storey living-room was to provide both the spatial and the plastic core;
from this wings serving different purposes would shoot out swastika-like.</p>

<p class='c010'>The relative homogeneity of Wright’s production in the first decade of the century,
following after the gradual convergence of his early work during the nineties, is explained
by the nearly identical problems and sites that he faced in designing the houses
mentioned so far. This homogeneity now gave way to an increasing variety that makes
it difficult to summarize the work of these years. The Coonley Playhouse, built on the
Coonley estate at Riverside in 1912, bears little resemblance to the original house of
four years earlier. The plan is cruciform and symmetrical; but what is new here is the
way the slab roofs, set at two different levels and pierced through their wide projections
in order to let light reach the windows below, were used to achieve an even more boldly
sculptural quality than in the project of 1902 for the Yahara Boat Club or the Gale house
of 1909. Wright’s mastery of abstract decoration was wholly mature by this time. From
the first he had used leaded glass in simple geometrical patterns in his windows,<a id="r408"></a><a href='#f408' class='c025'><sup>[408]</sup></a> but the
windows in this playhouse are the finest of all. Moreover, these festive compositions of
circles of coloured glass arranged asymmetrically resemble quite closely the abstract
paintings that such artists as Kupka, Delaunay, and the Constructivists would shortly
be producing in Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Northome, the F. W. Little house at Wayzata, Minn., of 1913, is also quite different
from all the earlier houses, yet not at all similar to the Coonley Playhouse. Raised on a
ridge above the southern shore of Lake Minnetonka, this house consists of a series of
pavilions—some open, some closed—strung along a single axis parallel to the water’s
edge. That containing the living room, which is of almost monumental size and scale,
dominates the whole. Wright seemed able now to invent a new mode almost with every
individual commission, each one with potentialities as great as those of the Prairie
Houses he had so thoroughly exploited in the decade before 1910.</p>

<p class='c010'>The major work of the immediate pre-war years, the Midway Gardens of 1913-14
on the Midway south of Chicago, is rather hard to define precisely. Not quite a beer
or <i>Heuriger</i> garden, nor yet a music-hall or cabaret in the ordinary European sense, the
establishment consisted of a large outdoor dining and entertainment area with raised
terraces on two sides, a stage and orchestra shed at the far end, and a closed restaurant
block towards the street. Here Wright’s ambitions as a decorative artist could have free
play. Abstract compositions of coloured circles like those in the windows of the Coonley
Playhouse appeared here as wall-high murals at the ends of the covered restaurant.
Moreover, the sculptural implications of the general composition of the playhouse were
carried farther in the openwork ‘constructions’ that he set on the tops of the towers. At
the same time he introduced a great deal of figurative sculpture stylized in a rather Cubist
way. Thus several different aspects of the abstract and near-abstract art which was just
coming into independent existence in Europe were closely paralleled in the adjuncts to
Wright’s architecture here.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>More architectonic patterns produced by simple geometrical means also ran riot at
the Midway Gardens. Notable and significant was the use of extensive areas of patterned
concrete blocks; these were somewhat like the patterned upper walls of the Coonley
house of 1908 but all monochrome. The early demolition of the Midway Gardens makes
it difficult to know whether this tremendous elaboration of the decorative aspects of
Wright’s architecture was symphonic or cacophonous in total effect. Whatever the
degree of their success or their failure, however, they opened a sort of ‘Mannerist’ or
‘Baroque’<a id="r409"></a><a href='#f409' class='c025'><sup>[409]</sup></a> period in his career that was destined to last for more than a decade.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the First World War, in 1915, Wright was approached by emissaries of the
Japanese Imperial Household to design and build the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. Proceeding
to Japan, Wright was largely concerned with this commission for the next seven
years, finally bringing it to completion in 1922. This is the principal production of his
‘Baroque’ phase. It was also a notable engineering triumph, for his ingenious use of
concrete slabs carried on a multitude of concrete piles brought it safely through the
earthquake of 1923. Paul Mueller, the engineer of the old Adler &amp; Sullivan office, was
his collaborator here.</p>

<p class='c010'>Abstract ornament proliferated on the hotel; some of it, carved in greenish lava,
elaborates the garden courts of the vast
<span class="sans">H</span>-shaped
plan; still more is painted in gold and
colour on the ceilings of the principal interiors. Moreover, the massive proportions of
the masonry walls produce an effect of castle-like solidity wholly inexpressive of the
method of their support and very far removed from the light and floating character of
the Prairie Houses. On the whole this hotel represents, far more than the Midway Gardens,
a cul-de-sac in Wright’s development.</p>

<p class='c010'>Overlapping the period of construction of the Imperial Hotel came a series of houses
in southern California in which the ‘Baroque’ element was gradually restrained. The
earliest of these, Hollyhock House in Los Angeles and two smaller houses near by, were
built for Aline Barnsdall in 1920 on a large estate bounded by Sunset and Hollywood
Boulevards, Edgemont Street, and Vermont Avenue. These are of poured concrete very
massively handled and carry considerable abstract sculptural ornamentation. For a
slightly later series of four houses around Los Angeles, beginning with the house of 1923
for Mrs G. M. Millard at 645 Prospect Crescent in Pasadena, Wright developed a type of
concrete-block construction with reinforcement in the joints that was of considerable
technical interest and also offered special decorative possibilities. The idea of using concrete
blocks cast with relief patterns of geometrical character goes back to the Midway
Gardens, however, and walls covered with repeating ornamental units had first appeared
at the Coonley house.</p>

<div id='i327'  class='figright id006'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 40. Frank Lloyd Wright: Pasadena, Cal., Mrs G. M. Millard house, 1923, plans</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In the Millard house, particularly, the scale of the moulded blocks and the ingenious
inclusion of pierced units—very similar to the pre-cast elements that Perret was using
for the screen walls of his Le Raincy church at just this time—produced a masterpiece
(Plate <a href='#pl144'>144</a>). This house, however, is not solely of interest for its construction and its
decoration. In contrast to the horizontal composition of almost all his earlier houses except
that in Racine for the Hardys, this is a tall vertical block, entered at the middle level,
with the dining room and kitchen below and the two-storey living room opening out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>to a balcony at the front (Figure <a href='#i327'>40</a>). The main bedroom is reached from a gallery overhanging
the rear of the living-room. Both organizationally and visually this represents a
surprising change, and the result closely resembled what a leading architect of the second
generation had just then been proposing in Europe (Figure <a href='#i369'>45</a>). There are, for instance,
no hovering eaves here; instead a parapet
continues the wall plane upwards and confines a
roof terrace. This is as close as Wright ever came
to building a ‘box-on-stilts’, his term of abuse for
the advanced European houses of the twenties. It
was as if, after the expansiveness of his work
from the Midway Gardens to Hollyhock House,
Wright wished to prove here his capacity to produce
a house modest in scale and compact in
section as well as in plan.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the next decade, from 1924 to 1934, Wright’s
actual production declined almost to zero although
he was working on a series of important
projects, some of which later provided the basis
for executed buildings. Taliesin was rebuilt after
a fire in 1925, however—it had already been
rebuilt once before after an earlier fire in 1914—and
a large house of concrete blocks, with almost
no use of pattern except for occasional pierced
grilles, was erected for his cousin Richard Lloyd
Jones in 1929 at 3700 Birmingham Road in Tulsa,
Okla. That is about all.</p>

<p class='c010'>The small M. C. Willey house of 1934 at 255
Bedford Street, S.E., in Minneapolis marked the
beginning of what proved to be almost a
second career for Wright. Low and
<span class="sans">L</span>-shaped,
with practically no ornament whatsoever, this modest brick house
introduced a major change in domestic planning. Not only are the
living room and the dining room completely unified, as was first done
at the Glasner house in 1905, but the kitchen—now re-christened
‘work-space’—opens into the main living area behind a range of glazed
shelves (Figure <a href='#i328'>41</a>). Thirty years later the full implications
of this development are still not quite digested in America or even
fully apprehended abroad; on the contrary, a reaction from open
planning has perhaps begun.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not the Willey house, however, modest in size and very quiet in expression for
all its revolutionary plan, that signalized the renewal of Wright’s activity. That he could
take up his career again at the highest level of creativity became apparent to everyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>with the construction of two much larger buildings both designed in 1936. Falling
Water, a large house in the Pennsylvania woods, is cantilevered over a waterfall with a
sense of drama even Wright had never hitherto approached. The Administration Building
for the S. C. Johnson Wax Company at 1525 Howe Street in Racine, Wis., his first
semi-industrial commission since the Larkin Building of 1904, was built in 1937-9. Both
are as remarkable for the technical boldness of their use of concrete—totally different in
the two cases—as for their design.</p>

<div id='i328'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 41. Frank Lloyd Wright: Minneapolis, M. C. Willey house, 1934, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Falling Water has a rear section built of rough stone which rises like a tower from the
native rock on the banks of Bear Run. From this solid vertical core are cantilevered out
a series of concrete slabs bounded by plain parapets at their edges. This produces a very
complex horizontal composition related to, but infinitely elaborated from, that of the
Gale house of 1909 (Plate <a href='#pl145a'>145<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The completely unified living space is closed in by stone
walls on the inner or dining side. It also extends out over the waterfall; the all-glass
walls on that side, with their thin metal mullions, hardly seem to separate the interior
space at all from that of the open terraces outside. A similar relationship exists between
the bedrooms and their terraces on the upper floors.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never before had Wright exploited the structural possibilities of concrete so boldly.
In this amazingly plastic composition—if ‘plastic’ be the word for anything so light and
suspended in appearance—it seems as if he had determined to outbid the European architects
of the second modern generation at their own games (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>). His early
work has, in the clarity and axial character of the organization and the serenity of its expression,
a classic if hardly a Classical quality; his work of 1914-24 shows a Baroque
exuberance in the proliferation of the ornament. Now that he was approaching seventy
his Romantic or anti-Classical tendencies—call them what you will—reached an intensity
of purely architectonic expression comparable to the musical intensity of the late quartets
of Beethoven that Wright so much admired. Falling Water, which might easily have
been the swan song of Wright’s career, soon to be halted again by a second World War,
proved in fact but the opening <i>allegro</i> in a new period of innovation and experiment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Johnson Building is very different from Falling Water. In it the curve rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>the cantilever provides the principal theme, and enclosure rather than interpenetration
of exterior and interior space controls both the planning and the design (Plate <a href='#pl146a'>146<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
The main office area is tall and unified, but it is filled with a forest of inverse-tapered
concrete piers rising from tiny bronze shoes to carry circular slabs of concrete whose
edges all but touch. The spaces between these lilypad-like disks were filled with tubes of
Pyrex glass, and bands of similar tubes are carried around the building below the balcony
and at the top of the plain red brick walls to provide additional natural light. In the
more specialized adjuncts to the general office area curved and diagonal plan-elements
lend a machine-like elegance to the shape of the building as a whole. Additional bands of
glass tubing interrupt the smooth and continuous masonry surfaces at intervals, thus
clearly indicating that these portions are of several storeys.</p>

<p class='c010'>Falling Water and the Johnson Building were large and expensive structures; so also
was Wingspread, the H. F. Johnson house that Wright built in Racine at the same time.
This is zoned in the manner of the Booth project of 1911 around a tall central core. But
in 1937 Wright also erected the first of what he called his ‘Usonian’ houses, the Herbert
Jacobs house at Westmorland, near Madison, Wis. This modest
<span class="sans">L</span>-shaped
dwelling, with
wooden ‘sandwich’ walls and a flat wooden slab roof, carried farther than the Willey
house the integration of the ‘work-space’ or kitchen with the main living area. Here
this rises in a masonry tower and is lighted by a clerestory, yet it is closely related to the
space of the interior as a whole. A very considerable range of Wright’s later houses are
variants of the Usonian model. Some were built before the War, even more in the last
decade; some are of modest dimensions like the Jacobs house, others much larger. They
exist in all parts of the United States, including the East, where he had hardly worked at
all before this time.</p>

<p class='c010'>The earlier Usonian houses were designed on a square module. This is true, for
example, of the version that he prepared for <i>Life</i> magazine in 1938,<a id="r410"></a><a href='#f410' class='c025'><sup>[410]</sup></a> which thereby received
the same sort of national circulation that the <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> gave to three of
his projects more than a generation earlier.<a id="r411"></a><a href='#f411' class='c025'><sup>[411]</sup></a> But Wright was now interested also in
developing the hexagon and the triangle as basic units. Beginning with the Hanna house
of 1937 at 737 Coronado Street in Palo Alto, Cal., he continued in many others to
explore the possibilities of planning based on 60-30-degree angles.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the most extraordinary house that he built in these pre-war years, his own winter
residence, Taliesin West, begun in 1938 in the desert outside Phoenix, Ariz., 45-degree
diagonals are used in the planning and almost all the structural elements are battered or
canted. However, it is the materials which give this edifice—like Taliesin itself at once a
house, a working place, and a school—its unique qualities. The substructure is of ‘desert
concrete’, that is great rough blocks of tawny local stone placed in forms and loosely
stuck together, so to say, with concrete; the superstructure is of dark-stained timber
frames mostly filled only with canvas to allow a maximum flow of air. As at the original
Taliesin in Wisconsin, Wright kept on enlarging Taliesin West, not always to its advantage.
Another example of ‘desert-concrete’ construction, the Rose Pauson house of
1940 in Phoenix, was destroyed by fire. It was, in its very sculptural way, a masterpiece
of this period unlike anything else he ever built and is still an impressive ruin.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>It was characteristic of Wright’s activity in his ‘second’ career that the versatility of his
invention knew no bounds. Many earlier ideas that had existed only in projects could
come to fruition now that his services were in such demand. At the same time it is hard
to believe that in the plain white stucco walls, extensive window bands, and thin roof
slab of the E. J. Kaufmann guest house, built just above Falling Water in 1939, or in
the G. D. Sturges house of the same year at 449 Skyway Road in Brentwood Heights
near Los Angeles, cantilevered out from a hill-slope, Wright was not consciously rivalling
the effects of the European architects of the second generation whom he professed
to scorn—rivalling them, but also making very much his own such of their effects as he
cared to emulate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wright did not drop the novel methods of construction that he had developed earlier
as he tried out new ones. In his most extensive late commission, the layout of a new
campus for Florida Southern College at Lakeland in Florida, begun in 1938, the plan
is highly formal at the same time that it is markedly asymmetrical. It thus elaborates
upon the angular themes of his project of 1927 for a desert resort at Chandler, Arizona—incidentally
the point at which his interest in 60-30-degree angles began. The buildings
at Florida Southern, starting with the Ann Pfeiffer Chapel of 1940 to which many
more were later added, are mostly of concrete-block construction, but with much less
use of patterned elements than in the executed work and projects of the twenties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Second World War interrupted Wright’s career less than the First. Various projects
initiated in the war years came to fruition soon after the war was over and gave
evidence of the continuing vitality of his powers of invention. The second house for
Herbert Jacobs at Middleton in the country west of Madison, Wis., was very different
from the Usonian one of 1937. Ever since an unexecuted house project of 1938 Wright
had been fascinated by the possibilities of using the circle in planning. While he had
tried out the form in the Florida Southern Library before the war, the Jacobs house
of 1948 was the first of a series of houses that he built with curved plans. Its two-storey
living area bends around a circular sunken garden court with the bedrooms
opening off a balcony above (Figure <a href='#i331'>42</a>). On the other side the house is half buried in
the hill-top, above which rise its walls of coursed rubble. A tower-like circular core
near one end of the convex side provides a strong vertical accent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another house of the post-war years, also based on the circle, is quite different in
character. The Sol Friedman house in Pleasantville, N.Y., is roofed with mushroom-like
concrete slabs; the two intersecting closed circles of the actual dwelling are balanced at
the end of a straight terrace parapet by the open circle of the carport (Plate <a href='#pl145b'>145<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
This was completed in 1949 with battered walls of almost Richardsonian random ashlar
masonry below a strip of metal-framed windows. A still later ‘house of circles’ for his
son David J. Wright was built near Phoenix, Ariz., in 1952. This is of concrete blocks
and raised off the ground, with the approach up a gently sloping helical ramp to the
various curved rooms on the first storey. The circle and the helix appear also in an urban
building of these years, the shop for V. C. Morris in Maiden Lane, San Francisco, completed
in 1949. Here the street façade is a sheer plane of yellow brick broken only by the
entrance, which is a Sullivanian—or Richardsonian—arch like that of the Heurtley house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>of 1902. Inside, a helical ramp rises around the central circular area beneath a ceiling
made of bubble-like elements executed in plastics.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 42. Frank Lloyd Wright: Middleton, Wis., Herbert Jacobs house, 1948, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A major work of these years, the extension of the Johnson Administration Building in
Racine, Wis., also completed in 1949, makes much use of circles also (Plate <a href='#pl146a'>146<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). North
of the existing office building Wright surrounded a square court with open carports
whose outer walls of solid brickwork shut out the surrounding city; inside these walls
are ranged short concrete columns with lily-pad tops like those in the section that he
built ten years earlier. In the centre of the ‘piazza’ thus defined rises a laboratory tower
of tree-like structure. The upper floors of this, alternately square with rounded corners
and circular, are all cantilevered out from a central cylindrical core which contains the
lift and the vertical canalizations. Alternate bands of brickwork and Pyrex tubing,
such as were used on the original building, enclose the tower except at ground level;
there the space of the court continues under the cantilevered floors above as far as the
solid central core.</p>

<p class='c010'>This relatively modest tower prepared the way for Wright’s skyscraper in Bartlesville,
Okla., of 1953-5, which has been mentioned earlier. Actually, however, this Price
Tower,<a id="r412"></a><a href='#f412' class='c025'><sup>[412]</sup></a> which is partly occupied by offices and partly by flats, is the final realization of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>a project originally prepared in 1929 for a block of flats for St Mark’s Church in New
York. This he had elaborated in the intervening years in projects for blocks of flats in
Chicago and for a hotel in Washington.</p>

<p class='c010'>While Wright was continuing to employ in his houses of the late forties and early
fifties a variety of modes of design that go back to the thirties, and also developing at
Florida Southern and in Bartlesville ideas dating from his inactive period in the late
twenties, he continued to strike out in other directions too. The Neils house at 2801
Burnham Boulevard on Cedar Lake in Minneapolis, Minn., completed in 1951, is all of
coloured marble rubble provided by the client; the Walker house at Carmel, Cal., completed
in 1952, is a glazed polygonal pavilion overhanging the sea. Where the Prairie
Houses of the first decade of Wright’s mature career may all seem in retrospect to have
come out of the same, or nearly identical, moulds, the many houses designed in his
seventies and eighties are notable for the great variety of their siting, their materials, and
the geometrical themes of their planning.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor was the domestic field anything like the sole area of his activity. In addition to
the college buildings, the shop, the skyscraper, and the laboratory that have been mentioned,
Wright built during the years 1947-52 a Unitarian church in Madison, Wis., of
very original character. The products of his multifarious activity in these years include,
moreover, many projects for all sorts of structures, some of which have been completed—notably
the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (Plate <a href='#pl188a'>188</a>). A
decade and more of designing and redesigning preceded the initiation of this
remarkable helical concrete building in 1956. Of three other late projects, those for an
opera-house in Baghdad and for an Arizona state capitol in Phoenix, dating from 1957,
are unlikely to be built; but the county buildings for Marin County, Cal., are now
well advanced.</p>

<p class='c010'>In spite of so much late activity, greater than that of his early maturity, in spite (or
perhaps, in part, because) of its kaleidoscopic variety, Wright’s actual influence was less significant
than forty years before; at least it was of a very different order. He still outpaced
his juniors both of the next generation and the one after; but few if any were able to
follow with any success along the intensely personal paths he opened.<a id="r413"></a><a href='#f413' class='c025'><sup>[413]</sup></a> Like Perret to
the end of his life, Wright continued at ninety to offer an inspiration to all architects,
but there has risen no school of imitators to vulgarize his manner as there was long a
school of imitators of Perret in France.</p>

<p class='c010'>In creative power, in productivity, and, over the forty years and more since 1910, in
influence, Wright overshadowed all the other American architects of his generation. Inspired
by Wright as well as by Sullivan, there flourished for a while a sort of ‘Second
Chicago School’ to which Purcell &amp; Elmslie; George W. Maher (1864-1926); Schmidt,
Garden &amp; Martin, and several other architects who were active in the Middle West
before the First World War may be considered to belong.<a id="r414"></a><a href='#f414' class='c025'><sup>[414]</sup></a> But this school flickered out
in the twenties as most of its members succumbed to the dominant ‘traditionalism’ of
the day or else ceased to find clients.<a id="r415"></a><a href='#f415' class='c025'><sup>[415]</sup></a> Four rather more vital and original architects
appeared shortly after 1900 in California: the brothers Greene (Charles S., 1868-1957, and
Henry M., 1867-1954), Irving Gill (1870-1936), and Bernard R. Maybeck (1862-1957).<a id="r416"></a><a href='#f416' class='c025'><sup>[416]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>But the productive careers of the Greenes, of Gill, and, to a lesser extent, that of Maybeck
came pretty much to a close, like those of the Chicagoans, around 1915 with the
resounding success of the ‘traditional’ buildings designed by Bertram G. Goodhue
(1869-1924) for the San Diego Exhibition of that year.<a id="r417"></a><a href='#f417' class='c025'><sup>[417]</sup></a> These were in the most ornate
sort of Spanish Baroque, quite archaeologically handled; and the emulation of them,
which at once became endemic in California, turned most local architects away from
innovation for almost twenty years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Maybeck, who had been a graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts in the eighties, contributed
to the San Francisco Exhibition<a id="r418"></a><a href='#f418' class='c025'><sup>[418]</sup></a> of the same year the still extant Fine Arts Building
in an equally ‘traditional’ but more Classical vein. Partly ruined today, his tawny
stucco columns and entablatures have the air of a painting by Pannini or Hubert Robert.
For all its charm, this was a surprising work to come from a man who had earlier shown
himself, in the Christian Science Church of 1910 in Berkeley, Cal., almost as bold an
innovator as Wright even though he employed for that a fantastically eclectic vocabulary
of reminiscent forms (Plate <a href='#pl146b'>146<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Many Berkeley houses, moreover, ranging
over several decades in date, also prove Maybeck to have been an architect of great
originality and surprising versatility.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Berkeley also are several houses by John Galen Howard (1864-1931) as well as his
building for the University of California’s School of Architecture, of which he was for
long the Dean. His building at the University (which has in addition a Faculty Club and
one or two other things by Maybeck), the Gregory house of about 1904, and the architect’s
own house of 1912 are also notable examples of free design dating from the first
decades of the century. Howard’s informal work is more directly related than are
Wright’s houses to the Shingle Style of the preceding period, though not specifically to
that of Richardson, for whom, however, Howard had actually worked in the mid
eighties before he came to California. Most of his work at the University, in fact, is
in an Italianate vein, and the campus is dominated by his tall, campanile-like clock tower.</p>

<p class='c010'>The production of the Greene brothers in this period, entirely domestic and largely in
Pasadena, offers a more coherent corpus than that of any modern American architect of
their generation except Wright. Related, like the work of Howard, to the Shingle Style,
which had been brought to Pasadena and Los Angeles by Eastern architects in the
eighties and nineties, the Greenes’ houses are most interesting for their successful
assimilation of oriental influences. The best example is the Gamble house at 4 Westmorland
Street in Pasadena of 1908-9 (Plate <a href='#pl147a'>147<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But the Pitcairn house of 1906 and the
Blacker house of 1907, at 289 West State Street and at 1157 Hillcrest respectively, as
well as the later Thorsen house of 1909, at 2307 Piedmont Avenue in Berkeley, now a
fraternity house, are also excellent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shingled walls, low-pitched and wide-spreading gables, and extensive porte-cochères
and verandas of stick-work surpassing in virtuosity those of the Stick Style,
were combined by the Greenes in rather loosely organized compositions. Less formal
and regular than Wright’s Prairie Houses, theirs are executed throughout with a
craftsmanship in wood rivalling that of the Japanese, whom they, like Wright, so much
admired. The Greenes’ plans are less open than Wright’s, but they made more use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>of verandas and balconies than he. Superb woodwork and fine stained glass combine
with the specially designed furniture in the interiors to produce ensembles of a sturdy
elegance hardly matched by any of Wright’s. Those in the Blacker and Thorsen houses,
whose clients were both in the lumber business, are especially rich.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, a ‘California Bungalow’ mode<a id="r419"></a><a href='#f419' class='c025'><sup>[419]</sup></a>—at worst but a parody at small scale of
the Greenes’ expensive mansions, at best sharing many of their virtues of directness and
simplicity if not of imaginative craftsmanship—became widely popular thanks to
national magazines, pattern-books, and the activities of many builders. This was true not
alone in the West but throughout the country in the very years after 1910 when ‘traditionalism’,
usually in Neo-Colonial guise, closed in most completely on American
domestic architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reputation of the Greenes today is less than that of the more articulate but less
consistent Maybeck. But when modern architecture revived in California in the thirties
the new men were fully aware of what the Greenes had accomplished. Thus their work
provided, together with that of Maybeck and Howard, a background and a tradition for
the local development of a largely autochthonous domestic architecture in the San
Francisco Bay area. This was a truly living tradition<a id="r420"></a><a href='#f420' class='c025'><sup>[420]</sup></a> quite unlike the abortive revival
of the architecture of the Spanish Missions, which it has now almost completely
displaced. But the Mission influence was not altogether a negative one in early
twentieth-century California, as the work of Irving Gill illustrates.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gill was less prolific than the Greene brothers, and most of what he built is less
striking. Like Voysey, he was in principle a reformer not a revolutionary, finding his inspiration
consciously in the local structural tradition of the early Spanish Missions and
<i>haciendas</i>. As a result some of his buildings, such as the First Church of Christ Scientist of
1904-7 in San Diego or in Los Angeles the Laughlan house of 1907 and the Banning
house of 1911, at 666 West 28th Street and 503 South Commonwealth Avenue respectively,
with their elliptically arched loggias and their grilles of ornamental ironwork,
are almost as ‘Spanish Colonial’ as the work of the outright traditionalists
around him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gill’s most interesting and mature houses, thanks to their smooth stucco walls, large
window areas, and avoidance of stylistic detail, can also have a deceptive air of being
European rather than American and of a period some years later than that in which they
were actually built. In his best work, such as the Dodge house (Plate <a href='#pl147b'>147<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) of 1915-16
at 950 North Kings Road in Los Angeles or the Scripps house at La Jolla of 1917, now
the Art Centre, the asymmetrically organized blocks, crisply cut by large windows of
various sizes carefully sashed and disposed, with roof terraces or flat roofs above, more
than rival the contemporary houses of the Austrian architect Adolf Loos (Plate <a href='#pl155a'>155<span class='fss'>A</span></a>)
in the abstract distinction of the composition. They even approach rather closely the
most advanced European houses of the next decade (see Chapters <a href='#ch21'>21</a> and <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Gill’s interiors are especially fine and also quite like Loos’s. Very different from
the rich orientalizing rooms designed by the Greenes, they are in fact more similar to
real Japanese interiors in their severe elegance. The walls of fine smooth cabinet woods,
with no mouldings at all, are warm in colour, and Voysey-like wooden grilles of plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>square spindles give human scale. The whole effect, in its clarity of form and simplicity
of means, is certainly more premonitory of the next stage of modern architecture than
any other American work of its period.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gill continued to practise intermittently down into the thirties, but his finest work
was done in the second decade of the century. He had little influence locally and still
less nationally, yet his best houses extend very notably the range of achievement of the
first generation of modern architects in America, even though his later production declined
sadly in quantity and even in quality. Wright alone was able to renew his career
successfully after the reaction against modern architecture that dominated America
from coast to coast during the twenty years from the First World War to the mid
thirties finally came to an end.</p>

  <h2 id='ch20' class='c013'><span class='c027'>CHAPTER 20</span><br />PETER BEHRENS AND OTHER GERMAN ARCHITECTS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> pattern of architectural development in Germany in the early decades of this century
was rather different from that in either France or the United States. No academy,
native or foreign, no influences from the École des Beaux-Arts discouraged innovation;
yet there was an early and general reaction against the whimsicality and the decorative
excesses of the Art Nouveau at which most of the younger men had tried their hands
before 1900. After the First World War, however, the example of Expressionism in
painting and sculpture led many architects to excesses of another sort. Expressionism in
architecture,<a id="r421"></a><a href='#f421' class='c025'><sup>[421]</sup></a> or something very close to it, is not restricted to Germany. The most
extreme example of any consequence, and probably the earliest, is Dutch, the Scheepvaarthuis
in Amsterdam of 1912-13 by van der Meij (see Chapter <a href='#ch21'>21</a>). In Germany
around 1920 various architects who had earlier been predominantly ‘traditional’ in their
approach were influenced by Expressionism, as well as others who were already programmatically
modern; nor was that influence restricted to the modern architects of
the first generation (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>
<p class='c010'>The boundary line between what, in retrospect, still seems definitely modern and
what now seems very similar to the ‘traditional’ work of these decades in other countries
is much less sharp than in America. And no German architect of their own generation
had the continuously creative achievement of a Perret or a Wright to his credit. Nevertheless
Peter Behrens stands out among his contemporaries because of the vigorous boldness
of his industrial buildings. Moreover, the influence of his factories of around 1910
was crucial on the next generation, and several of the later leaders actually worked in
his office at that relevant period. Yet all but Behrens’s finest work can be matched in
the production of other German architects; while his own vitality as an innovator was
rather strictly limited to a few years and to what he did for one corporate client. That
client was the A.E.G. (German General Electric Company), which had already employed
Messel down to his death in 1909.</p>

<p class='c010'>Messel and Ludwig Hoffmann (1851-1932) dominated the architectural scene in
Berlin, where the latter was appointed City Architect in 1896 on the strength of his vast
academic Imperial Law Courts of 1886-95 in Leipzig. In the early years of the century
they both developed a formal mode that was more ‘traditional’ than modern. Despite
Messel’s and Hoffmann’s usual preference for conventional sixteenth- or eighteenth-century
models, Behrens was certainly not uninfluenced by their mode of design, even
though his more positive sources of inspiration were of a less conservative order. Yet,
in so far as one can sort out the different architectural camps in Germany in these years,
Behrens must be considered well to the artistic ‘left’ of Messel and Hoffmann.</p>

<p class='c010'>Germany was certainly very receptive to new ideas in decoration when Behrens’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>architectural career began at the turn of the century—receptive rather than creative. There
were other Germans who handled the Art Nouveau with considerable originality besides
August Endell, notably Bernard Pankok (b. 1872) and Richard Riemerschmid
(1868-1957); but two foreigners, neither of them very prolific builders, seem to have
been the most influential figures on the German architectural scene at the opening of the
new century. The Belgian Van de Velde had moved from Paris to Berlin in 1899; the
Austrian Olbrich was called to Darmstadt by the Grand Duke in the same year. Olbrich
stayed at Darmstadt until his early death in 1908; Van de Velde, however, left Berlin in
1902 when he was invited to Weimar to head the School of Arts and Crafts there which
later became the Bauhaus. Van de Velde’s finest Art Nouveau furniture dates from his
Berlin years around 1900. As late as 1906,<a id="r422"></a><a href='#f422' class='c025'><sup>[422]</sup></a> the Central Hall which he designed in the
Dresden Exhibition showed him still a competent if rather heavy-handed decorator
in the Art Nouveau tradition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Van de Velde’s remodelling of the Folkwang Museum at Hagen of 1900-2, quite
Art Nouveau in its details, his Esche house at Chemnitz of 1903, and his Leuring
house at Scheveningen in Holland of the next year, both very massive and heavily
mansarded though unornamented externally like his own house of 1895-6 at Uccle,
hardly require particular mention. However, for the school that he headed in Weimar
he completed in 1906 a building even more devoid of Art Nouveau elements and notably
straightforward in character. The plain white stucco walls below his usual heavy
mansards were very frankly fenestrated with ranges of wide studio windows, perhaps
in emulation of Mackintosh’s Glasgow Art School. Indeed, the general effect is even
simpler and more rectilinear than that of its possible Scottish prototype. The problem
of his responsibility or lack of responsibility for the design of the Théâtre des Champs
Élysées in Paris of 1911-13 has already been discussed (see Chapter <a href='#ch17'>17</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Van de Velde continued to build occasionally throughout all his long life—some
portions of his Kröller-Müller Museum near Otterlo in Holland were only completed
in 1953—but his last pre-war work was the theatre that he designed and executed in
1913-14 for the Werkbund Exhibition at Cologne. Some trace of the massively plastic
quality of his Dresden hall of 1906—so different from the delicacy and grace of the
Art Nouveau in its best period—remained in the curved walls and roof of this edifice,
but the whole effect was lighter and plainer, more abstract one might almost say.</p>

<p class='c010'>The resemblance of Olbrich’s Ernst Ludwig Haus of 1901 at the Darmstadt Artists’
Colony to Mackintosh’s Art School has already been noted (see Chapter <a href='#ch17'>17</a>). At Darmstadt
he also continued to build houses for some years, and his work there culminated
in the Exhibition Gallery and the Wedding Tower on the Matildenhöhe, erected in
1907. The former was blocky and somewhat classicizing in character, at once very plain
and very formal. The latter, of brick, had a more Hanseatic flavour because of its arched
and panelled gable; but it also included a novel motif, bands of windows that seem to
carry round a corner, that was destined to be very influential everywhere in the twenties.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the next and last year of Olbrich’s life—he died, it will be recalled, at the early age
of forty-one—two important commissions came to him away from Darmstadt. The
Feinhals house at Marienburg near Cologne repeats the blocky symmetrical composition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>of the Exhibition Building, the walls being articulated only with flat oblong panels.
The loggia between, however, has a range of Greek Doric columns, clear evidence
of the influence of Romantic Classicism that was growing stronger in Germany all
through this decade. But Olbrich had little real appreciation of the subtle elegance of
the work of Schinkel and his contemporaries, or so it would appear from this house.</p>

<p class='c010'>The buildings of the East Cemetery in Munich, designed by Hans Grässel (1860-?)
in 1894 and completed in 1900, are perhaps the first examples of this sort of ‘Neo-Neo-Classicism’.
Yet beside the contemporary Neo-Baroque of the Munich Palace of
Justice built in 1897 by Grässel’s master, Friedrich von Thiersch (1852-1921), nearly as
over-scaled and aggressive as Wallot’s Reichstag in Berlin, the rather Schinkelesque
work at the cemetery appears, in its crispness and its relative simplicity, almost as
‘modern’ as anything by Olbrich. As has been noted earlier, Schinkel remained a major
inspiration to such a leader of the second generation of modern architects as Mies van
der Rohe, so this influence has a continuing significance.</p>

<p class='c010'>A much larger building by Olbrich than the house at Marienburg, also completed in
the year of his death, the Tietz (now Kaufhof) Department Store in Düsseldorf, repeats
the reiterative verticalism of those portions of Messel’s Wertheim store in Berlin that
were built in 1900-4, though Olbrich’s detailing is not medievalizing like Messel’s but
rather semi-Classical. Neither of these later things maintains the promise of his Ernst
Ludwig Haus; they rather illustrate that general recession from bold innovation which
characterized the architecture of this decade in Germany, a recession corresponding
more or less closely to the general resurgence of ‘traditionalism’ in England and America
that came a few years later (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Peter Behrens (1868-1940), only a year younger than Olbrich, began his career as an
architect at Darmstadt. From 1896 on, before being called there, he had only done
decorative work of a markedly Art Nouveau sort. In his own house in the Artists’
Colony of 1900-1—the only one not built by Olbrich—the interiors are still quite Art
Nouveau, but the clumsy exterior has little interest except as a document of revolt.
Yet the plan is quite like that of Wright’s own house of 1889 in Oak Park, allowing a
real flow of space through wide openings between entrance hall, living-room, and
dining-room. By 1902 the ‘Hessian’ interior that he contributed to the Turin Exhibition
was wholly rectilinear, presumably under the influence of Olbrich and Mackintosh.
A similar severity characterized the work that he did, much of it merely open pergolas,
for the Düsseldorf Garden and Art Exhibition of 1904.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time Behrens’s personal style was maturing, although his debt to Olbrich remained
very evident. The Art Pavilion for the North-West German Art Exhibition held
in Oldenburg in 1904 was a symmetrical composition of cubical masses, the flatness of
their surfaces even more emphasized by linear panelling than in Olbrich’s work. The
Obenauer house of 1905-6 at Sankt Johann near Saarbrücken is rather more loosely
composed; indeed, its white stucco walls, slated roofs, and grouped windows distinctly
recall Voysey’s houses, which were by this time very well known in Germany thanks
to the <i>Studio</i> and Muthesius’s book. The garden front, however, is symmetrical and
the plan not as open as that of his own house of four years earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>In Behrens’s next two buildings, the small Concert Hall in the Flora Garden at
Cologne of 1906 and the large Crematorium at Delstern near Hagen completed the following
year, the geometrical panelling in black and white, used both inside and out,
recalls a little San Miniato in Florence. But the blocky geometry of the Oldenburg
pavilion and its smooth flat surfaces were also repeated, so that both these buildings have
a curiously model-like look as if they were made of sheets of cardboard.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behrens’s two finest works up to this time, the Schröder house of 1908-9—no longer
extant—and the Cuno house of 1909-10 in the Hassleyerstrasse at Eppenhausen near
Hagen, have a much more solid appearance, with quarry-faced masonry below and
roughcast walls above (Plate <a href='#pl148b'>148<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The symmetrical façades, which correspond to
completely symmetrical plans, are at once more tightly and more subtly composed.
Here English influence seems to have been superseded by an attempt, rather more successful
than Olbrich’s at Marienburg, to emulate Schinkel. A third early house by
Behrens, the Goedecke house at Oppenhausen of 1911-12, is equally formal but not
symmetrical, recalling thus a little Schinkel’s Schloss Glienecke near Potsdam.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat similar to Behrens’s work of this period in its evident derivation from German
Romantic Classicism, but more delicate in scale, was the work of Heinrich Tessenow
(1876-1950), notably his Festival Theatre of 1910-13 and the other buildings he designed
and erected for the Art Colony at Hellerau near Dresden. But such German work,
of which a great deal was produced in the decade before the First World War, corresponds
rather closely, despite the frequent stylization of detail and the serious concern
with geometrical clarity in composition, to the Neo-Georgian of England and America
in the early twentieth century, and also to much parallel work in the Scandinavian
countries that is usually of rather higher quality (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, those Frenchmen who castigated the Théâtre des Champs Élysées as
‘Boche’ during the First World War because of the presumption that it was designed by
Van de Velde, born a Belgian but head of a German art school, were not altogether
wrong. In its scraped Classicism and rigidly geometrical <i>ordonnance</i> Perret’s façade was
not at all remote from one of the most characteristic German modes of the years just
before 1914. Perret’s industrial work was, of course, much more significant for the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>So also with Behrens it was the challenge that his position as architect of the A.E.G.
brought of working in the industrial field that made him briefly a rival of Wright, and
even more particularly of Perret, as a major architectural innovator. Behrens’s first work
for the A.E.G., the Turbine Factory at the corner of the Hussitenstrasse and the Berlichingenstrasse
in Moabit, an industrial suburb of Berlin, was erected in 1909 immediately
upon his appointment as successor to Messel. This broke new ground in several ways. It
was built partly of poured concrete, partly of exposed steel, with both materials very
directly expressed (Plate <a href='#pl149a'>149<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The side wall of
glass and steel more than rivals in its openness those of the
department stores designed by Art Nouveau architects
(Plates 131<span class='fss'>B</span> and 133). But Behrens’s façade, in
contradistinction to
theirs, has no applied ornament
whatsoever. Moreover, he ordered the whole composition as carefully as Schinkel might
have done if either large factories or metal-and-glass construction had come within his
purview.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The end façade of the Turbine Factory is slightly less frank in design. The concrete
corners on either side of the central window-wall of metal and glass are battered and
striated horizontally as if to suggest rusticated masonry. The gable of the multi-faceted
roof is brought forward to shelter the window-wall; this projects slightly in front of the
concrete corners, almost like a Shavian bay-window raised to industrial scale. The treatment
of the window-bands of the lower concrete block to the left resembles that of
Schinkel’s articulated walls on the Berlin Schauspielhaus, but with all the Greek mouldings
omitted. Thus the functional elements of a factory executed throughout in new materials
were here for the first time in Germany architectonically ordered with no dependence
on decoration of any sort. Wright had done much the same four years earlier in his
little-known E.-Z. Polish Factory in Chicago, but the scale of that is modest and its
walls are not extensively fenestrated. Perret had come closer to it in his Garage Ponthieu
in Paris, also built in 1905. There can be little question, however, that Behrens’s is the
finest building of the three.</p>

<p class='c010'>In two more factories built in 1910 for the A.E.G., both much larger but neither of
them quite so striking, Behrens broadened his range as an industrial architect. The High
Tension Factory in the Humboldthain is of brick, not concrete or steel. Except for a few
minor elements somewhat suggesting pedimented temple-fronts translated into an industrial
vocabulary, he handled the vast façades here with the same directness as the side
elevation of metal and glass at the Turbine Factory. The Small Motors Factory in the
Voltastrasse is similar but much finer (Plate <a href='#pl148a'>148<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). There the brick piers have rounded
corners and rise unbroken almost the full height of the building. The effect is somewhat
like that portion of Messel’s Wertheim Store which was built in the late nineties, but the
scale is larger, and there is none of Messel’s rich, half-traditional, half-Art-Nouveau detailing.
Instead, the careful proportioning and the suave but extremely straightforward
treatment of the structural elements again suggests Schinkel’s sort of ‘rationalism’ yet
succeeds in doing so, as at the earlier Turbine Factory, with almost no reminiscence of
actual Romantic Classical forms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thanks to the widening range of responsibility that German industry was now ready
to give architects, Behrens not only built these big factories for the A.E.G. and also
redecorated their retail shops all over Berlin, but he was soon asked in addition to provide
some blocks of flats for the company’s workmen at Hennigsdorf outside Berlin.
This was a social challenge which neither Wright nor Perret had to meet. (In fact, however,
Wright did in 1904 design terrace-houses that were never executed for Larkin
Company workers in Buffalo; while in France low-cost housing had a very important
place in Garnier’s projects for a ‘Cité Industrielle’.) Henceforth, such housing would
be a major preoccupation of most modern architects. This is true not only in Germany
but all over the western world, and especially in Holland and Scandinavia. The origins
of low-cost housing go back to the 1840s in England when Henry Roberts, whose Fishmongers’
Hall in London has been mentioned, became the first architect to specialize in
this field. But the early history of housing<a id="r423"></a><a href='#f423' class='c025'><sup>[423]</sup></a> is of more sociological than architectural
interest. Moreover, what the nineteenth century esteemed to be ‘model’ low-cost
dwellings have too often had to be demolished as ‘sub-standard’ in the twentieth. Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the interest and activities of present-day architects may not spare the twentieth century
the shame of building again as a public service what posterity will consider slums.</p>

<p class='c010'>Various small A.E.G. factories for making porcelain, lacquer, and other specialized
products were also erected by Behrens in 1910 and 1911, none of particular interest.
In 1911-12, however, there followed the Large Machine Assembly Hall at the
corner of the Voltastrasse and the Hussitenstrasse near the Small Motors Factory. This
rivals in quality the Turbine Factory of 1909. Once more a great rectangular volume is
covered with a multi-faceted steel-framed roof, the structure below being in this instance
also of steel with no use of concrete. The metal frame is largely filled with glass, but
brick was introduced at the base and on the ends. The scale of this unit is less monumental
than that of the Turbine Factory, though the size is much greater. The general effect,
particularly that of the interior with its travelling cranes, is at once light and dramatic.
A big A.E.G. plant was also built by Behrens at Riga in Russia in 1913.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three large non-industrial commissions of 1911-12 show how this work for the
A.E.G. affected Behrens’s approach to design. Although it is built of stone not brick, the
German Embassy (Plate <a href='#pl027a'>27<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) opposite Monferran’s St Isaac’s Cathedral in Petersburg is,
at first sight, deceptively like the Small Motors Factory. Actually, the façade has a range
of engaged Doric columns, but by their tall slim proportions and their lack of entasis
these were, so to say, ‘industrially’ stylized. The great scale, the absolute regularity, and
a certain coldness surely derived in part from the factories of the previous two years; but
these also recall Romantic Classical monuments of Alexander I’s time in Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behrens’s enormous office building for the Mannesmann Steel Works on the Rhine at
Düsseldorf was less successful, as was also that for the Continental Rubber Company in
Hanover. The latter was designed in 1911 and begun in 1913, but not completed until
after the First World War, in 1920; it was destroyed in the Second World War. The
heavily reiterative sort of scraped Classicism Behrens used for these overpowering
masonry blocks lacked the subtlety of composition of the Hagen houses yet retained
something of the directness of expression of the A.E.G. factories. They were not untypical,
however, of much large-scale German building of the second and third decades
of the century. This mode developed fairly directly out of the Berlin work of Messel
and Ludwig Hoffmann, although it was usually much less specifically ‘traditional’ in its
detailing and even more aggressive in scale; a not dissimilar mode returned to official
favour under Hitler in the mid thirties, usually with very coarse detailing.</p>

<p class='c010'>With these big office buildings by Behrens and others one may compare the work of
this period by various other German architects who preferred less classicizing modes.
Early buildings by Fritz Schumacher (1869-1947), such as his crematorium in Dresden
of 1908, also illustrate the megalomaniac tendencies of the period that seem so expressive
of the expansive ambitions of William II’s Second Reich. The many schools
that Schumacher built in Hamburg just before the First World War are simpler, although
still rather heavily scaled, and more comparable in quality to Behrens’s work. One in
particular, built in 1914 in the Ahrensburgerstrasse, almost echoes the elongated colonnade
of Behrens’s Petersburg Embassy, but the ‘columns’ are plain piers executed in
dark red brick<a id="r424"></a><a href='#f424' class='c025'><sup>[424]</sup></a> and strung along a front that is concave not flat. The bath-house at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Eppenhausen, also of 1914, is very like the schools; while in the Kunstgewerbe Haus of
the previous year on the Holstenwall in Hamburg a similar mode was employed for
what is, in effect, a large office building. This seems to have initiated a local tradition of
design for commercial buildings which was maintained in the twenties with little
change, not only by Schumacher but by several other Hamburg architects. Schumacher’s
cemetery chapel, built as late as 1923, follows much the same line.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Stuttgart the railway station by Paul Bonatz (1877-1951) and F. E. Scholer
(b. 1874) is the finest though not the largest of several built in Germany in these years.
Designed in 1911, it was started only in 1914, just as the enormous and much less interesting
one at Leipzig with its six parallel sheds, begun by Wilhelm Lossow (1852-1914)
and M. H. Kühne in 1907, was reaching completion. That at Stuttgart was not
finished until 1927 because of the interruption caused by the First World War. This
structure has a rather Richardsonian flavour in its extensive unbroken wall surfaces of
rock-faced ashlar and its plain round arches (Plate <a href='#pl152'>152</a>). But the influence here came
rather from the Munich architect Theodor Fischer (1862-1938). Fischer’s Romanesquoid
churches, such as that of the Redeemer in Munich of 1899-1901 and the Garrison Church
of 1908-11 in Ulm, were among the largest and most strikingly novel built in the opening
years of the century in Germany; in the latter he even used ferro-concrete principals
to carry the roof of the nave. Fischer’s Art Gallery of 1911 in Stuttgart was both more
delicate in scale and rather more archaeological in its detailing; Bonatz’s Stuttgart work
is bolder, simpler, and quite as admirably expressive of the traditional materials used.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the Stuttgart Station may be contrasted the rather earlier one at Hamburg that
Heinrich Reinhardt (1868-?) and Georg Süssenguth (1862-?) built in 1903-6. There the
major sections—shed, concourse, etc.—designed by the engineer Medling resemble
rather closely Contamin and Dutert’s Galerie des Machines at the Paris Exhibition of
1889. These great constructions of iron and glass fortunately quite overshadow the low
ranges of accessory elements in masonry, with ornament still in the Meistersinger mode
of the eighties, contributed by the architects. The differences between these two notable
stations well illustrate that reaction towards masonry construction and a more or less
traditional approach to design that was developing strength in the decade preceding the
First World War. In the history of the railroad station as a type the Hamburg Hauptbahnhof
represents, not a new beginning, but the end of a line descending from the
great shed-dominated stations of the mid nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Intermediate in date between the Hamburg and Stuttgart stations was that at Karlsruhe
built by August Stürzenacker in 1908-13. Although masonry construction and
masonry forms dominate here as at Stuttgart, the simplification of mass and space composition
throughout, and above all the elegant detailing, give evidence of the continuing
leadership of Olbrich at the time of his death. Olbrich never built a station himself,
but he won third place in the 1903 competition for that at Basel and second place
in the 1907 competition for Darmstadt.</p>

<p class='c010'>In other specialized fields of building a forward line of development is more evident.
Two big circular halls, one in Frankfort built by Thiersch in 1907-8, the other in
Breslau built by Max Berg (b. 1870) in 1910-12 (Plate <a href='#pl149b'>149<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), are more notable than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>contemporary railway stations at Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. Like Behrens’s industrial
work for the A.E.G., these structures illustrate the vital stimulus that German architects
were obtaining in these generally somewhat reactionary years from the use of engineering
solutions and materials other than masonry—steel at Frankfort, ferro-concrete at
Breslau—to cover and enclose space. In the case of Thiersch this is the more remarkable
when one remembers the ponderous traditionalism of his Neo-Baroque Palace of Justice
in Munich built ten years before. While Berg on the exterior of his vast hall approaches
the attenuated Classicism of Perret’s work of the next decade, the superb interior reminds
one at once of Piranesi and of the much later structures of Nervi.</p>

<p class='c010'>German architects of this generation were rarely able to carry over into the designing
of more conventional structures the boldness and freshness of approach of their large-scale
work. They seem to have felt no such call to regenerate architecture as Wright had
imbibed from Sullivan; nor did they, like Perret, attempt to use the new materials and
the new structural methods consistently for all sorts of buildings whatever their particular
purpose. German production before and after the First World War, as represented
in the <i>œuvre</i> of such then highly esteemed figures<a id="r425"></a><a href='#f425' class='c025'><sup>[425]</sup></a> as Oskar Kaufmann (b. 1873),
German Bestelmeyer (1874-1942), and Wilhelm Kreis (b. 1873), to mention but three
of the best known, shades over almost imperceptibly from industrial and semi-industrial
buildings of bold and original character to a range of structures in various tasteful modes
that are, in retrospect, hardly distinguishable from the traditional work of this period in
other countries. This has already been noted as regards Tessenow. Characteristic
examples of these men’s work were Bestelmeyer’s extensions of the University and the
Technical High School in Munich, of 1906-10 and 1922 respectively, both in the local
tradition of Theodor Fischer’s work. The Museum of Prehistory in Halle that Kreis built
in 1916 with K. A. Jüngst was more traditional even than Bestelmeyer’s work, although
Provincial-Roman rather than Romanesque in inspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>As in England in the late nineteenth century, individual idiosyncrasies were much
cultivated, and architects tended to specialize in particular types of buildings. Kaufmann,
for example, had a very personal Neo-Rococo manner, delicate and frivolous, that he
employed with real appropriateness in various Berlin theatres, notably the remodelling
of the Kroll Oper and the Komödie, both carried out in 1924. But Behrens remains
on the whole the most interesting and accomplished architect of this generation, whose
opportunities for building were often to be even greater under the Weimar Republic
in the early twenties than they had been under the Kaiser.</p>

<p class='c010'>No very great change is observable in Behrens’s work after the First World War.
The terrace-houses that he built in 1918 for A.E.G. workers at Hennigsdorf, and the
semi-detached dwellings of a low-cost housing estate for which he was responsible at
Othmarschen near Altona in 1920 are simple and solid in construction, quite like those
of before the war but more conservative in design. However, at this point comes a
characteristic, though brief, change of phase that illustrates his ready response to influences
from the new painting and sculpture of the day. In the big complex erected for
the I. G. Farben Company in 1920-4 at Höchst Behrens gave up the direct expression of
new industrial building methods characteristic of his A.E.G. factories of 1909-11. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>exterior was massive and almost medievalizing, even though the ranges of arches were
of the unconventional parabolic form that seems to have appealed especially to Expressionist
taste. In the tall glass-roofed court inside the angular forms of Expressionism were
most strikingly evident; but he also introduced wholly abstract wall paintings and a few
rather Constructivist lighting fixtures elsewhere in the reception rooms and offices. The
result was, to say the least, ambiguous and incoherent, although the exterior was not
unimpressive in its general effect.</p>

<p class='c010'>Expressionist influence had first appeared a little earlier than this in the work of other
German architects, but it reached a peak in these years of the early twenties. In his pre-war
industrial work Hans Poelzig (1869-1936) was not yet Expressionist. The chemical
works that he built at Luban near Posen in 1911-12 rivalled in size and even in directness
of expression—though not in distinction—Behrens’s factories for the A.E.G. After the
war, however, Poelzig became a principal exponent of Expressionism in architecture.
One of the earliest and most striking examples of Expressionist design on a large scale
was his remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus in Berlin in 1919. Here the cavernous,
stalactite-ceilinged interior round the central circular stage was itself like an Expressionist
stage-set and the planning implied a major revolution in dramatic presentation that
never, in fact, quite came off. Yet his industrial work of the early twenties soon became
much more straightforward again, and he later reverted to something very comparable
to the stripped monumentality of Behrens’s Düsseldorf and Hanover office buildings.
The most prominent extant example of this is the enormous I.G. Farben Company
headquarters that he built in 1930 in Frankfort.</p>

<p class='c010'>One can hardly leave the subject of Expressionism in German architecture, largely
confined though its more extreme manifestations were to a very short post-war period
of three or four years, without mentioning two more names, those of Fritz Höger
(1877-1949) and Dominikus Böhm (1880-1955).</p>

<p class='c010'>The twenties saw a few skyscrapers erected in Germany, none of them of the great
height then current in America, but sometimes as conspicuous above the existing skyline
as the first skyscrapers in New York had been in the seventies. The largest, though not
the tallest, and certainly the most impressive was the Chilehaus, built by Höger in Hamburg
in 1923, with its Schumacher-like piers of patterned brickwork and its upper three
storeys receding behind narrow terraces (Plate <a href='#pl153a'>153<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). A large and irregular site encouraged
the employment of a long double curve on the right-hand side of the hollow block,
and the sharp angle at that end produced automatically a silhouette of the shrillest
Expressionist order. Actually, however, Höger like other German architects was already
returning by this time from earlier and wilder Expressionist adventures. To what extent
he was aware of the skyscrapers of Sullivan is uncertain. The emphatically vertical
scheme of design he used here, with arches linking the brick piers together below slab
cornices, certainly suggests some knowledge of them, even though they were by this
time all but forgotten in America.</p>

<p class='c010'>Considerably taller than the Chilehaus, but not otherwise very distinguished, were
two other German skyscrapers of the twenties. Kreis’s Wilhelm Marx Haus of 1924 in
Düsseldorf, a thirteen-storey tower crowned with curious openwork tracery of inter-laced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>brick, is still a conspicuous feature of the local skyline; but the Planetarium and
associated buildings that he erected at the Gesolei there two years later are better
examples of the fairly restrained mode that he and others usually employed in these
years. The plainer and better proportioned seventeen-storey Hochhaus am Hansaring
in Cologne was built in 1925 by Jacob Koerfer (b. 1875).</p>

<p class='c010'>Although only a few skyscrapers actually rose in European cities in the twenties, the
theme nevertheless fascinated the younger architects. Many bold designs for them
were projected, some of them of real significance for later developments in both the
Old World and the New (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>). The international competition for the
Chicago Tribune Tower held in 1922, which many Europeans entered and the Finn
Eliel Saarinen all but won, signally focused attention on a type of building hitherto considered
unsuitable for the Old World, and generally accepted in Europe only in the
1950s (see Chapters <a href='#ch21'>21</a> and <a href='#ch25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The churches of Böhm, all of them Catholic, have a suavity that Höger’s work lacks,
but at least equal forcefulness. The Suabian War Memorial Church of 1923 at Neu-Ulm
is like an imaginative film-set of the period, being a sort of free fantasia on Gothic
themes with little feeling of structural reality. But the boldest of Böhm’s churches, that
he built at Bischofsheim in 1926, seems almost to take off from the engineer Freyssinet’s
hangars at Orly. The paraboloid forms are here very frankly used; yet the concrete
‘barrel’ vault of the nave, intersected by lower cross-vaults over the bays of the aisles,
creates a strong emotional effect that is both Gothic and Expressionist in tone. The finest
of his churches, however, may be Sankt Engelbert at Cologne-Riehl of 1931-3. This is
circular in plan and very ingeniously roofed, not with a dome,<a id="r426"></a><a href='#f426' class='c025'><sup>[426]</sup></a> but with lobes of paraboloid
barrel-vaulting.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, in a church built in 1929, Sankt Josef at Hindenburg in Upper Silesia, Böhm
had already turned away from the emotionalism of his earlier work towards simple
rectangular forms.<a id="r427"></a><a href='#f427' class='c025'><sup>[427]</sup></a> This simplicity he has maintained in his post-war churches, with the
result that his last work, Maria Königin,<a id="r428"></a><a href='#f428' class='c025'><sup>[428]</sup></a> built at Marienburg outside Cologne in 1954,
with its squarish plan, very slender metal supports, and side wall of glass, has very little
churchly flavour left. Yet some of Böhm’s very late projects indicated that many of his
ambitions of thirty years ago still remained with him to the end; they may well some day
find effective expression at the hands of his son or of Rudolf Schwarz now that a more
emotional approach to church-design has been revived internationally.</p>

<p class='c010'>Compared to such a French church of the twenties as Perret’s Notre-Dame at Le Raincy
or such a Swiss church as Moser’s Sankt Antonius in Basel, both using concrete in the
rectangular and skeletal mode usually preferred at that time, Böhm’s churches of the
twenties once seemed semi-traditional rather than modern. One can now see, however,
that there is a different and more emotive line of development in modern church
architecture to which, for example, Gaudí’s unfinished churches at San Coloma and
Barcelona belong, as do also such later Latin American examples in ferro-concrete as
the Purísima at Monterrey in Mexico by Enrique de la Mora (b. 1907) of 1939-47,
São Francisco at Pampulha in Brazil, built by Oscar Niemeyer (b. 1901) in 1943,
Nuestra Señora de los Milagros in Mexico City by Felix Candela (b. 1910), completed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>in 1955, and several completed in the mid fifties by Juvenal Moya at Bogotá in
Colombia<a id="r429"></a><a href='#f429' class='c025'><sup>[429]</sup></a> (see Chapters <a href='#ch23'>23</a> and <a href='#ch25'>25</a>). Expressionism may have been less of a cul de
sac than its brief impingement on Behrens might lead one to suppose. Certainly it was
a potent force for a few years after the First World War, and played then a significant
role in breaking down the rule of ‘tasteful’ traditionalism inherited from the preceding
decade.<a id="r430"></a><a href='#f430' class='c025'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>As the twenties progressed, however, and extreme Expressionist influence generally
receded, Behrens gave evidence of his awareness of the quite different direction that
modern architecture had just taken in the hands of certain younger men, several of
whom had actually been his own pupils or at least his employees. In 1925-6 he built
New Ways, a house in Northampton, England, for S. J. Bassett-Lowke, earlier a client
of Mackintosh’s. With its smooth white stucco walls, horizontally grouped windows,
and flat roof, this is of considerable historical interest, although of very little intrinsic
merit.<a id="r431"></a><a href='#f431' class='c025'><sup>[431]</sup></a> No such advanced work had yet been done in England by local architects, and
at this time only a very few houses of a comparably advanced character had been
executed anywhere (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite his unusual openness of mind, which led Behrens in his fifties to attempt to
rival juniors barely started on their careers—or, quite as probably, because of the lack of
strong personal conviction of which this gives evidence—Behrens did not, like Perret
and Wright in later life, continue to be very creative beyond this date. In Vienna, where
he was called in the mid twenties to be professor of architecture at the Akademie, he
settled into a sort of compromise mode. The low-cost housing blocks that he built in
Vienna in 1924-5 on the Margaretengürtel, in the Stromstrasse, and in the Konstanziastrasse
illustrate his characteristic uncertainty of direction in these years. If considerably
sounder, they are also much less adventurous than the Bassett-Lowke house designed at
almost the same time. This can be seen still more clearly at the Weissenhof in Stuttgart
where many of the buildings of the German Werkbund’s housing exhibition held in
1927 remain in use today. There Behrens’s block of flats stands very near one designed
by the director of this exhibition, his former assistant Mies van der
Rohe (Plate <a href='#pl162b'>162<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), and not far from houses by such other
leaders of the new generation as Gropius, Le
Corbusier—who had both worked in his office also—and Oud (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>). The
contrast between his massive block and their light and open structures is the more
striking because Behrens here so evidently set out to meet his juniors more than half-way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behrens’s very latest work, the factory for the Austrian Tobacco Administration at
Linz built in 1930 in association with Alexander Popp (b. 1891), was rather less conservative
because of the nature of the commission. It is less mechanistic than the industrial
work done so much earlier for the A.E.G., yet nonetheless impressive for its consistency
of treatment and also for its human scale. The Linz factory provides a not unworthy
concluding note to Behrens’s ambiguous career.</p>

<p class='c010'>The vast productivity of the German architects of Behrens’s generation, both before
and after the First World War, building in a boom which only came to a close around
1930 with the world-wide depression, makes it difficult to choose specific examples
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>worth the emphasis of even brief mention. The situation is made no easier by the considerable
versatility of most of the leading figures. Those few buildings that have been
specifically mentioned—even most of Behrens’s own work except for his A.E.G. factories—should
be considered typical of the upper level of German achievement in these
decades rather than monuments of unique distinction like the best things done by Perret
and by Wright in the same decades. Yet, it is worth noting, for a long time neither
Wright nor Perret had much effect on the general scene in their own countries, for all
the seminal effect of their influence on younger architects everywhere; while the Germans
achieved a tremendous volume of what can be called ‘half-modern’ work that
notably changed the whole character of several large cities. Thus the way was prepared
for a very early and widespread acceptance of the next stage of modern architecture,
an acceptance so premature that it induced in the thirties a sharp reaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1933 a regime rose to power in Germany with doctrinaire objections to the latest
phase of modern architecture, ironically castigated as <i>Kultur-Bolschevismus</i> immediately
after the Bolsheviks had rejected it as unacceptably bourgeois! As a result, the leaders of
the younger generation almost all emigrated (see Chapter <a href='#ch23'>23</a>); while with few exceptions
those German architects who remained at home turned backwards in their tracks, though
not very far backwards. Most German production in the Nazi period is all but indistinguishable,
indeed, from what was considered most advanced before the First World
War and even for some years thereafter. Very little of it deserves specific mention. As
was the case around 1910, the more nearly the structures were of an engineering order—as
for instance Bonatz’s bridges for the Autobahn built over the years 1935-41—the less
they were likely to be stylized along the heavy near-Classical or semi-medieval lines the
later Imperial period had established as conventional a generation before. Even the
housing that Bonatz built after the War in 1945-6 at Ankara in Turkey and his Opera
House there of 1947-8 are hardly as advanced as his Zeppelinbau office building of
1929-31 opposite the station in Stuttgart. Like Behrens at the same time, he had attempted
there—with a certain amount of real success—to follow the ascetic principles of
the younger generation that had just been so well illustrated at Stuttgart in the Werkbund
Exhibition of 1927 on the Weissenhof (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Immediately after the Second World War there was for several years some continuing
use of the modes of 1910, so to call them. This was natural because of the prolonged
absence of most of the leaders of the intervening generation from the country—Gropius,
Mies, and Mendelsohn never returned—and the renewed activity of so many of the
older generation who had made their reputation in the period 1905-25 with which this
chapter has chiefly dealt. Today it is as if Germany had lived through the stylistic
developments of the twenties a second time, and now the newer sort of architecture is
once again as ubiquitous there as it was in 1930.</p>

<p class='c010'>These tidal waves of changing taste in Germany, each representing a sharp reaction
against its predecessor, make difficult such a focusing of attention on a few creative and
insurgent figures as gives dramatic pungency to the history of these decades in America
and France. <i>Jugendstil</i>, <i>Expressionismus</i>, <i>Neue Sachlichkeit</i>,<a id="r432"></a><a href='#f432' class='c025'><sup>[432]</sup></a> these general movements,
more than even so distinguished an individual as Behrens, are the real protagonists of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>the German story from 1900 to 1933; but in the international frame of reference they
must be subordinated to the broader currents that dominated the architecture of the
western world in the period. In that frame of reference the contribution of a few
Austrians more than equalled that of the more prolific Germans, down at least to the
First World War.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> development of modern architecture in Austria between 1900 and the Nazi conquest
has many connexions with that of Germany. The Austrian Olbrich had as much as
anyone to do with setting off the reaction against the Art Nouveau in Germany after
1900. From the mid twenties, Behrens was living in Austria, not in Germany. Even
so, and particularly for the years before the First World War, there is a separate and
purely Austrian story, more limited than the German story yet at least equally notable
for highly distinguished achievement. Two Austrian architects at least, Otto Wagner
and Adolf Loos (1870-1933), if not Wagner’s pupil Josef Hoffmann (1870-1956), were
the equals of any of the leading German architects of their day, except perhaps Behrens.
Wagner, already sixty in 1901, produced his finest work after that date. The Wiener
Werkstätte, founded by Hoffmann in 1903, provided a centre of activity in the field of
decoration comparable to what the Century Guild and the Arts and Crafts Exhibition
Society had offered earlier in England. Above all, Loos—in part possibly because he,
of all Europeans of his generation, knew American architecture best—demonstrated,
from his earliest executed work of 1898, a determination to renew the art of building
that was as revolutionary as Wright’s.</p>
<p class='c010'>Soon after 1900 Wagner threw off all Art Nouveau influence. Yet the finest element
in his masterpiece, the central hall of the Postal Savings Bank in the Georg Coch Platz
in Vienna of 1904-6, still retains in the curvature of its glass roof and the tapering of its
metal supports something of Art Nouveau grace (Plate <a href='#pl154b'>154<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The exteriors of this
massive edifice are lightened by the very original treatment of the geometrically organized
wall-planes; the thin plaques of marble which provide the sheathing suggest
volume, not mass, and the delicate relief of the few and simple projections quite avoids
the ponderousness of most contemporary German work. As in so much of the best German
work, however, the severity of form and even the specific character of certain ornamental
features reflect in a stylized way the Grecian mode of a hundred years earlier.
This is somewhat surprising in Vienna, where Romantic Classicism had been on the
whole both unproductive and uncreative, but doubtless Wagner knew Schinkel’s work
as well as did Behrens—certainly his lightness of hand is more comparable to Schinkel’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not least interesting technically is the consistent employment of aluminium<a id="r433"></a><a href='#f433' class='c025'><sup>[433]</sup></a> in this
building. The sculptured figures by Othmar Schimkowitz which crown the façade and
the visible bolts that retain the granite and marble plaques are of this new metal; so also,
apparently, are the structural members that support the glazed roof of the hall; at least
they are completely sheathed with it. The large rear block of the bank dates from 1912,
but the original vocabulary was retained by Wagner with only some slight simplification
of the detailing of the plaquage.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Sankt Leopold, the cruciform church that serves as the chapel of the Steinhof Asylum
on the Gallitzinberg at Penzing outside Vienna, was built by Wagner in 1904-7 at the
same time as the Postal Savings Bank. This crowns his extensive hillside layout of the
whole establishment, comparable in scale to the French asylums of the mid nineteenth
century, but for the other buildings he was not directly responsible. Sankt Leopold is
a large domed monument inviting comparison with Schinkel’s Nikolaikirche at Potsdam.
However, the linear stylization of the detailing inside and out brings to mind
Olbrich’s and Behrens’s buildings of its own day. There is no paraphernalia of Greek
orders, yet the conceptual organization of the elements is certainly in the Romantic
Classical tradition, with the four arms each quite cubic and the hemispherical dome
raised on a cylindrical drum. As at Schmidt’s Neo-Gothic Fünfhaus church of the
1870s in Vienna, there are echoes of Fischer von Erlach’s Baroque Karlskirche here also,
but the spirit is not at all Baroque. All the visible metalwork here, the sheathing of the
dome, the statues of angels by Schimkowitz and of saints by Richard Luksch, and even
the heads of the bolts that retain the marble plaques on the exterior walls, is of gilded
bronze, not aluminium. This has not worn as well, for it has lost its gilt coating, peeled
off many of the bolts, and streaked the walls with verdigris. Inside the church the mosaics
by Rudolf Jettmar and the stained glass by Kolo Moser combine to rival the most
sumptuous domestic ensembles produced by the Wiener Werkstätte, but the general
effect, while light and even gay, still has a monumental dignity appropriate to a church.
The walls are of plain white plaster, and narrow bands of geometrical ornament in gold
and blue panel the cross vault—for, curiously enough, the central dome is not exploited
internally.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crisper in design and much simpler altogether than the Steinhof church are the blocks
of low-cost flats that Wagner built in 1910-11 at 40 Neustiftsgasse and next door at
4 Döblergasse. Their walls are covered with stucco lined off to suggest plaquage, and the
decoration is reduced to thin bands of dark blue tiles that merely outline the surface
planes. Needless to say, these blocks have not survived as well as the expensively built
bank and church. Wagner’s last works, a hospital not far from the Steinhof Asylum and
his own house at 28 Hüttelbergstrasse, both in Penzing and of 1913, are typical but rather
less interesting.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hoffmann’s first architectural work of any consequence, a Convalescent Home at
Purkersdorf built in 1903-4, was already simpler than Wagner’s hospital of a decade
later, if considerably less architectonic in effect. The plain white stucco walls are full of
ample windows almost devoid of surrounding frames and very regularly disposed;
cornices and other conventional elements of detail are either omitted or reduced to an
absolute minimum. The result is a structure that would still look very fresh and crisp
half a century later were it not, like Wagner’s flats, in shabby physical condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Hoffmann’s founding of the Wiener Werkstätte indicates, he was at
heart less an architect than a decorator, like so many of the leading
English and Scottish designers of this period and the immediately
preceding one. The important commission to build a large and extremely
luxurious mansion on the edge of Brussels in 1905, the Palais Stoclet
at 373 Avenue de Tervueren, gave his decorative ambitions a free rein
(Plate <a href='#pl154a'>154<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Yet the exterior of this has a good deal of the geometrical clarity of the Convalescent
Home and rather more of Wagner’s architectonic values. The carefully
ordered asymmetrical composition is dominated by the stair-tower, somewhat as the
best Italian Villas of the previous century were dominated by their off-centre belvederes.
The walls appear to be no more than thin skins of marble plaques, like Wagner’s, with
the frequent and regularly spaced windows brought forward into the same surface plane.
A decorative edging of gilded metal defines these smooth wall planes, giving the whole
something of the fragile look of D’Aronco’s exhibition buildings. This is especially
true of such a complex accent as the tower, with its tall stair-window.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Stoclet house, as finished after six years in 1911, has some very fine interiors, cold
and formal but sumptuously simple in their use of various marbles. The marble is quite
undecorated on the delicate rectangular piers in the two-storey stair-hall; but in the
dining-room it carries inlaid patterns by Gustav Klimt of almost Art Nouveau elaboration.
The effect is rather curious, somewhat resembling characteristic English interiors
by Voysey and his contemporaries carried out, not in stained or painted wood, but in
figured and polished marbles; yet undoubtedly this is one of the most consistent and
notable great houses of the twentieth century in Europe. Seeking to provide a new sort
of elegance that even the best English domestic work lacked, Hoffmann achieved here
an urbane distinction only approached by Gill and the Greenes at this time in America.
His houses in Vienna, such as that at 5-7 Invalidenstrasse of 1911 and the suburban
one at 14-16 Gloriettegasse in Hietzing, are not in a class with the Palais Stoclet but
more comparable to Olbrich’s or Behrens’s houses of this period in Germany. Work
of similar character and equal distinction was done by Fabiani in Vienna before he
settled in Gorizia in 1920. Very Hoffmann-like indeed is his building for the publisher
Artaria at 9 Kohlmarkt of 1901. His Urania in the Uraniagasse of 1910 also rivals Hoffmann’s
best.</p>

<p class='c010'>Successor to Wagner in general esteem, and himself a professor at the Kunstgewerbeschule,
Hoffman developed his personal style no further in the work he did after the
First World War. At the Austrian Pavilion in the Exhibition of Decorative Arts of
1925 in Paris—an exhibition organized in part to reclaim for France the primacy in the
arts and crafts of decoration that had by this time passed to Vienna, largely because of
Hoffmann’s leadership—the rather Neo-Rococo stuccoed block that he provided was
much less advanced in character than the greenhouse-like portion designed by Behrens.
However, his low-cost flats in the Felix-Mottlstrasse in Vienna, built like those of
Behrens in the mid twenties, retain a good deal of the quality of his early sanatorium at
Purkersdorf. Crisp and clean, they are distinctly less blank and ponderous than Behrens’s,
if also less advanced in design that those by Josef Frank (b. 1885). Frank, a somewhat
younger Viennese architect of considerable ability but lesser reputation than Hoffmann,
left Vienna to settle in Sweden when the Nazis took over Austria.</p>

<p class='c010'>The international acclaim that Viennese low-cost housing of this period received
when new seems rather exaggerated now. From the first its significance was more
political and sociological than architectural. It happened to be built, moreover, mostly
by men not of the newest generation of architects at just the time when an architectural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>revolution was taking place in France and Holland and Germany
(see Chapters <a href='#ch22'>22</a> and <a href='#ch23'>23</a>).
Henceforth that revolution, brilliantly illustrated as regards low-cost housing in the
German Werkbund’s international exhibition of 1927 at Stuttgart, would affect most
notably the design of such projects throughout the western world. The Viennese housing
exhibition of 1930, a modest counterpart to that in Stuttgart, came too late to reform
the local tradition, which largely survived even after the Second World War.</p>

<p class='c010'>The work of Hoffmann’s exact contemporary Loos dates less than his and was of the
greatest importance in providing inspiration to the modern architects of the second
generation who brought about the revolution of the twenties. This inspiration from
Loos is comparable in significance to that which the younger architects found in the
work of Wright and of Perret. Loos, unlike other Austrians of his period, was primarily
interested in architecture, not in decoration—indeed, he wrote in 1908 an article<a id="r434"></a><a href='#f434' class='c025'><sup>[434]</sup></a>
claiming that ‘ornament is crime’, an attitude shared by no other architect of his
generation, and least of all by his fellow Viennese. It was Loos’s tragedy that a very large
part of his employment before the First World War was in remodelling and redecorating
flats; this constrained him so little, however, that many of these may easily be taken
in photographs for completely original house interiors (Plate <a href='#pl155b'>155<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Although Loos began his career in the late nineties when the Art Nouveau tide ran
highest, he was never at all affected by it, in part doubtless because he had spent the years
1893-6 in America beyond the range of Art Nouveau influence. The interior of the
Goldman haberdashery shop in Vienna, which he designed in 1898, was entirely
straight-lined and quite without any ornament; in the Café Museum of the next year
the segmental ceiling and the bentwood chairs were curved, but only for structural
reasons. Both are now gone, although the extant Knizé men’s shop in the Graben in
Vienna of 1913 gives some idea of what the former was like.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is Loos’s houses around Vienna, in Plzen, in Brno, in Montreux, and in Paris that
place him as one of the four or five most important architects of his generation. His
finest single extant work, however, is a small bar in Vienna. From the first he designed
from the inside out, reducing his exteriors to square stucco boxes cut by many windows
of different sizes and shapes. The results are very like Gill’s houses in California, as has
been noted already, but with no such traditional elements as Gill’s arched porches. This
is especially true of the Gustav Scheu house in the Larochegasse in the Vienna suburb of
Hietzing, almost the only one left in Austria in something closely approaching its
original condition (Plate <a href='#pl155a'>155<span class='fss'>A</span></a>; <a href='#i353'>Figure 43</a>). Loos was an enthusiastic admirer of English
domestic architecture; this bent of his taste is curiously illustrated by his liking for English
eighteenth-century furniture of the Queen Anne and Chippendale periods, which
looks today so out of place in his severely rectangular rooms. But the architectural
character of his interiors is never influenced by eighteenth-century modes, but only by
the most advanced English work of the opening of the century which he knew well
through the <i>Studio</i>. Articulated by plain wooden structural members like Voysey’s interiors
or, on occasion, by similar piers clad with marble like Hoffmann’s in the Stoclet
house, Loos’s suites of living areas are as flowing as Wright’s<a id="r435"></a><a href='#f435' class='c025'><sup>[435]</sup></a> but he never provided
as much interconnexion between indoors and out.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Of a succession of houses built before the First World War the much mishandled
Steiner house of 1910 and the above-mentioned Scheu house of 1912, both in suburbs of
Vienna, are perhaps the finest. The Villa Karma, built much earlier at Montreux in
Switzerland in 1904-6, had an almost Hoffmann-like sumptuousness of materials and
finish within; but in the main Loos kept, like Voysey and Wright, to plainer effects and
simple dark wooden trim.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>At first his houses looked, externally, rather like quite conventional ones from which
all elements of traditional detail had been scraped, as do many of the contemporary projects
included in Garnier’s ‘Cité Industrielle’. Gradually, however, Loos came to handle
his simple elements of external design with more of that assurance which his domestic
interiors had displayed from as early as the flat in Vienna remodelled for Leopold Langer
in 1901 (Plate <a href='#pl155b'>155<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Both the placing and the sashing of his windows were more
carefully studied; and the proportions and the juxtapositions of his rather boxy masses
were abstractly ordered well before a Neoplasticist like Georges Vantongerloo in Holland
arrived at somewhat similar effects in sculpture (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>). Compared to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Wright’s more complex and articulated experimentation with abstract composition in
the house of 1909 for Mrs Thomas Gale or the Coonley Playhouse of 1912, there remains,
nevertheless, a distinctly negative quality about all Loos’s work. He seems to have
been principally concerned to clear away inherited tradition in order to lay the foundations
of an immanent new architecture. That new architecture, however, he himself was
never able to bring fully into being, although others did so under his influence by the
time he was in his early fifties (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In Loos’s larger urban work, such as the prominent Goldman &amp; Salatsch Building of
1910 in the Michaelerplatz in Vienna, he was ready to use marble externally and even to
include classically detailed columns. But in the ground storey of this store he increased
the articulated space effects characteristic of the interiors of his flats and houses to almost
monumental scale. Here, in the small Kärntner Bar of 1907, and in the Café Capua
of 1913, both also in Vienna, his use of fine materials with their polished surfaces
uninterrupted by mouldings would eventually prove as potent an inspiration to architects
of the next generation as did his more ascetic written doctrine.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Café Capua is gone; the Goldman &amp; Salatsch interior drastically remodelled;
but the Kärntner Bar, in the Kärntner Durchgang behind 10 Kärntnerstrasse, remains a
small masterpiece of modern design. During the Nazi occupation the façade lost the
American flag in stained glass which ran across the top, but the exterior was never of
much interest in any case. The interior is fortunately completely intact (Plate <a href='#pl151'>151</a>).
Skilful use of mirrors quite disguises its very small dimensions. Above smooth dark
mahogany walls, set like screens between plain green marble piers, unframed panels of
mirror that reach to the ceiling allow one to see the strong reticulated pattern of the
yellow marble ceiling extending left and right and to the rear just as if the actual area
of the bar were merely an enclave in a much larger space. Because of the particular
height of the mahogany wainscoting this illusion is quite perfect, for one sees only
about as great a space reflected on either side as that one is actually in; if the mirrors
came lower, a greater extension on either side and at the rear would be suggested than
could possibly be plausible as a reflection. A continuous grille of square panels filled with
translucent yellow onyx takes the place of the mirror panel across the top of the front
wall. Not until Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Pavilion of 1929 was marble used again
by a modern architect with such assurance (Plate <a href='#pl165a'>165<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not these urban commissions, however, but Loos’s free-standing houses that
the next generation of architects studied most closely. For example, Loos’s sort of
domestic open planning, not Wright’s, was probably the major influence on the Continent
after the First World War. Moreover, the neutrality, not to say the negativity, of
the exteriors of his houses provided better even than Garnier’s projects the raw material
with which a positive sort of architectural design could be created by younger men in
the early twenties. Loos’s achievement before the First World War was largely in the
domestic field; after the war most of his executed work still consisted of houses and
shop interiors, although he made several extremely interesting projects for larger edifices
and erected a large sugar refinery for the Rohrbacher Company in Czechoslovakia in
1919.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>The Rufer house in Vienna of 1922 is a narrow three-storey block rather similar to
Voysey’s Forster house of 1891 at Bedford Park. This has a most interesting sort of open
plan, with the dining-room on a higher level than the living room. Loos was also working
in other countries now; for his reputation, though limited to the most advanced
circles, was increasingly international. His most considerable production of this decade
was the house he built in 1926 for the writer Tristan Tzara at 14 Avenue Junod in Paris,
where Loos had settled four years earlier. In the Tzara house the interior is arranged somewhat
like that of the Rufer house: the dining room opens into the living room but on
a higher level. The tall, rather blank front, slightly concave in plan, has a more positive
character than those of most of his houses, because the two-storey void sunk into its
centre provides a dominating plastic feature above the solid rubble of the ground storey.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of still later work the Kuhner house of 1930 at Payerbach in the wooded hills near
Vienna is the most original example. A two-storey hall, opening towards the view
through a window-wall, occupies most of the interior, with the various other living
spaces opening into it on the main floor and the bedrooms reached from a gallery
above. Above the masonry base the house is externally of log-construction, chalet-like,
with Tyrolean roofs of low pitch and wide-spreading eaves. This reversion to
peasant materials, and even to peasant forms, was curiously premonitory of a direction
modern architecture took in several countries in the thirties (see Chapter <a href='#ch23'>23</a>). Had Loos
lived longer he might, like Wright in that decade, have returned to the centre of the
stage. As it was, his major contribution antedated the First World War.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perret, Wright, Behrens, and Loos: on the whole these are the four most important
architects of the first modern generation, important both for their personal contribution
and also for their decisive influence on later architecture. Outside the countries
in which these men worked, notably in Holland and in Scandinavia, there were also
architects of distinction belonging to this generation but their achievement was more
limited and their influence more local, at least before the First World War. Yet Holland,
between 1910 and 1925, came closer than any other country to creating a modern
style, or phase of style, that was universally accepted at home; the origins, moreover, go
back to the nineties. There was, properly speaking, no prefatory Art Nouveau episode
in Holland of any consequence in spite of a considerable activity in the decorative arts
inspired, in part at least, by serious study of the crafts of Indonesia.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hendrik Petrus Berlage (1856-1934), the leader of the national school, was considerably
older than Perret, Wright, Behrens, or Loos, although much younger than Wagner.
As in Wagner’s case, his earliest work, dating from the eighties, is of a generically
Renaissance character, though much less suave and academic. The influence of Cuijpers
soon led him towards a medieval mode—not Gothic, however, but round-arched.
Compared to <i>Rundbogenstil</i> work of the best period fifty years earlier, his round-arched
buildings of the nineties are rather gawky, but not without originality in their ornamentation;
above all, they are vigorously structural in their expression in a ‘realistic’
and, indeed, almost High Victorian way. However, the insurance company buildings in
Amsterdam and The Hague that best illustrate this phase were later enlarged by him in a
chaster mode, thereby losing much of their anachronistic flavour.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Berlage’s major opportunity came with the competition for the design of the Amsterdam
Exchange held in 1897. This competition he won with a project which seems rather
Richardsonian<a id="r436"></a><a href='#f436' class='c025'><sup>[436]</sup></a> to American eyes, though he did not—apparently—know much about
American work at that time. For this very extensive public edifice, built over the years
1898-1903, he used, not the stone of his insurance office across the Damrak of 1893, but
the red brick of his Hague insurance office, also of 1893, varied with a modicum of
stone trim still quite crudely notched and chamfered. Inside, the principal interior has
exposed metal principals above galleried walls of brick and stone. In Berlage’s masculine
vigour and defiant gracelessness of detailing one could hardly have a greater contrast to
such another major public building, designed and built at almost precisely the same time,
as Horta’s Maison du Peuple in Brussels. But Horta’s masterpiece climaxed rather than
opened his career as an architect of international importance; certainly it did not lead to
the development of a national modern school in Belgium. At least for Holland, the
Exchange was more seminal, even if it lacked the revolutionary character of Wright’s
houses of these years or Perret’s block of flats in the Rue Franklin in Paris. A fairer comparison
would be with Voysey’s contemporary houses, the work of an architect who
was by intention rather a ‘reformer’ than a drastic innovator, or with Martin Nyrop’s
Town Hall in Copenhagen begun five years earlier.</p>

<p class='c010'>Berlage’s near-Richardsonian mode of this period is still better illustrated in a smaller
structure, that built for the Diamond Workers’ Trade Union in the Henri Polak Laan
in Amsterdam in 1899-1900 (Plate <a href='#pl150'>150</a>). In this, the organization of the windows into a
sort of brick-mullioned screen and the less aggressive handling of the carved stone detail
produces a façade not unworthy of comparison with Richardson’s Sever Hall or
Gaudí’s Casa Güell (Plate <a href='#pl096b'>96<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). It is notable, however, that it is work of the seventies and
eighties in America and in Spain that comes to mind, not work of this date.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hotel American of 1898-1900 in the Leidse Plein in Amsterdam by Willem
Kromhout (1864-1940) illustrates how boldly Berlage’s line was taken by other local
architects, and his relative originality even outrivalled. But the lead came in Kromhout’s
case not from Berlage, but from Cuijpers’s nephew Eduard (1859-1927), a transitional
figure whose work deserves more attention outside Holland than it has generally received.
Kromhout’s touch is lighter than Berlage’s, as is also, to make a poor pun, the
colour of his pale buff bricks, but his expression of structure is less ‘real’ and more
frankly fantastic. In the detail of the exterior, and even more in the interiors, he was undoubtedly
seeking to create a sort of Dutch alternative to the Art Nouveau, not curvilinear
or naturalistically ‘organic’ but richly decorative in a semi-abstract way. The
intention was worthy; the result, alas, is rather tawdry.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not in the design of sumptuous individual buildings but in low-cost housing
and in city-planning that Berlage himself was most active in the next fifteen years. In
1908, for example, he prepared a plan for the extension of The Hague, and in 1915 a
more ambitious one for Amsterdam. He had built his first blocks of flats in the Linnaeusstraat
in Amsterdam in 1905. These are much less Romanesquoid than his earlier
work but they are equally brusque as to the detailing. However, his architecture shortly
grew much suaver. Berlage’s finest work of any period, perhaps, is not in Holland but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>in the City of London, Holland House of 1914 at 1-4 Bury Street, E.C. This has a reticulated
façade of moulded terracotta members more Sullivanian than Richardsonian in
its verticality (Plate <a href='#pl138b'>138<span class='fss'>B</span></a>)—and by this time he certainly knew Sullivan’s work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The influence of Berlage in Holland was by this time very great and the esteem in
which he was held—at least as much for his doctrine of direct structural expression as for
his executed work—by no means restricted to his own country, since his writings were
published in Germany as well as in Holland.<a id="r437"></a><a href='#f437' class='c025'><sup>[437]</sup></a> Yet, to foreign eyes, the achievement
of the new school that grew up partly under his inspiration in Amsterdam is greater
than his own. The work of this ‘Amsterdam School’—for it was soon so called—which
flourished particularly in the decade 1912-22 is at times very close to that of the German
architects influenced by Expressionism in the early twenties; but it began much
earlier and has a strongly autochthonous flavour.<a id="r438"></a><a href='#f438' class='c025'><sup>[438]</sup></a> German Expressionism never inspired
a building more stridently angular than the Scheepvaarthuis that J. M. van der Meij
(b. 1868), a pupil of Eduard Cuijpers, built to house dock offices on the Prins Hendrik
Kade in Amsterdam in 1912-13. The most extreme example of the abandon with which
twentieth-century Dutch architects set out on new paths, this opened the way for the
housing work of van der Meij’s assistants Michael de Klerk (1884-1923) and P. L.
Kramer (1881-1961), both also pupils of Eduard Cuijpers, which represents internationally
the greatest Dutch contribution to modern architecture. As the master of these
three, Eduard Cuijpers, despite his own historicism, has perhaps as much right as Berlage
to be considered a father of the Amsterdam School. Their work, moreover, has some
analogies not only with German Expressionism but also with Wright’s contemporary
Baroque phase of 1914-24. However, the crystallization of de Klerk’s personal style preceded
the beginning of Wright’s influence in Holland and, when that influence began
during the years of the First World War, it operated in fact to counter the extravagances
of the Amsterdam School.</p>

<p class='c010'>Early buildings by de Klerk, such as the first Eigen Haard Estate housing blocks that
were designed in 1913 and erected round the Spaandammerplantsoen on the west side
of Amsterdam, have a quaintness that recalls English or American work of a generation
earlier rather than van der Meij’s aggressive angularity. They look almost as if they were
especially fanciful projects of the Shingle Style that happened to be executed in brick
instead of wood. But the elegant underscaled local brick is handled with extraordinary
virtuosity, and the façades achieve a stage-set-like unreality in sharpest contrast to the
often dreary matter-of-factness of low-cost housing produced in other countries in these
same years. Although the first Eigen Haard blocks were, in planning and general
organization, as straightforward as Berlage’s, they have a warmer human touch such as
architects elsewhere—Behrens, for example, or the Scandinavians—either missed entirely
or attempted to attain by a parsimonious use of more or less ‘traditional’ detailing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The extension of the Eigen Haard Estate along the Zaanstraat, begun in 1917, represents
perhaps the peak of de Klerk’s achievement (Plate <a href='#pl156b'>156<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Here the many curved
wall elements bring out the special qualities of Dutch brickwork; and the rather heavy
wooden window-frames, brought forward as in Hoffmann’s Stoclet house to the wall-plane,
give continuity to the plastic modelling of the façades. Highly imaginative, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>whimsical, features of detail, such as the barrel-like corner oriel, give an air of good
humour, and even of the outright humorous, that is rare in any other architecture,
ancient or modern; but these features are for the most part truly architectonic, not
merely decorative. De Klerk’s whimsy is never nightmarish, in the way Gaudí’s can be,
nor loud and aggressive like van der Meij’s. His highly personal style can be considered
a sort of <i>barocchino</i> of the early twentieth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>The extreme point of de Klerk’s invention is seen in the post office that occupies the
apex of the later portion of the Eigen Haard Estate. This is like nothing so much as a
child’s toy enlarged to architectural scale in some contemporary setting for Diaghilev’s
Ballet Russe.<a id="r439"></a><a href='#f439' class='c025'><sup>[439]</sup></a> After this his work grew somewhat simpler and more orderly. Already
the blocks he designed in 1920 for an area round the Henriette Ronnerplein in the
De Dageraad Estate on the south-east side of Amsterdam are more regular and restrained;
the plainest of all is the very long continuous range near by in the Amstellaan
built in 1921-2.</p>

<p class='c010'>Also in the De Dageraad Estate, in the portion that runs down both sides of the P. L.
Takstraat, along the Burgemeester Tellegenstraat and into the Talmastraat, Kramer
showed himself even more of a virtuoso in the handling of curved wall elements of
brick—here brown and buff—than de Klerk (Plate <a href='#pl156a'>156<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Projected in 1918 and built in
1921-3, Kramer’s scheme combined tall and very plastic features at the street intersections
with notably straightforward three-storey ranges in between. Thus he produced
an extensive urbanistic ensemble of great homogeneity of character, yet very considerable
variety of visual interest, and with a quality of craftsmanship perhaps superior
to de Klerk’s. But by the time this was completed Kramer had become even more
chastened than de Klerk in his last work in the Amstellaan. In Kramer’s Amsterdam West
housing, begun in 1923, the façades are plain and flat with continuous bands of white-sashed
windows. Thus these blocks are definitely related to the direction that modern
architecture was taking in Holland as in France and Germany in these years at the hands
of men of Kramer’s own generation (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Kramer’s De Bijenkorf department store of 1924-6 in the Grotemarktstraat in The
Hague, however, still retains much of the plastic exuberance of his earlier housing
blocks and is executed with a sumptuous range of fine materials. Kramer here employed
at large scale the curved surfaces of brickwork characteristic of De Dageraad, with
notable success. Many Amsterdam canal bridges of these years illustrate also his
virtuosity at elaborate semi-abstract detail carried out with excellent craftsmanship in
wrought iron and carved or artificial stone. Moreover, in the mid twenties the Amsterdam
City Architect’s office exploited with real success in various school and police
buildings a manner closely approaching that of de Klerk and Kramer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unfashionable even in Holland for a quarter of a century, the work of the Amsterdam
School merits that more sympathetic examination which the Art Nouveau has now
for some years received. At its best the work of de Klerk and Kramer from the mid
teens to the mid twenties has survived better than all but the finest contemporary
achievements of Wright and Perret, partly because it was so well built in the first place
and has been so well maintained ever since. Without being, in the proper sense of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>word, Expressionist, it yet has close analogies with the Expressionist approach. It may
be considered to stand in a relationship to the work of Höger and Poelzig in Germany
somewhat comparable to that of Gaudí to the Art Nouveau of Brussels and Paris; for
it is at once independent of outside influence and superior to the foreign work that it
most closely parallels. But the Amsterdam School did not occupy the entire Dutch scene
even in these, its best, years.</p>

<p class='c010'>In no European country was the work of Frank Lloyd Wright studied earlier and
with more enthusiasm than in Holland; Berlage was one of Wright’s greatest admirers
after his visit to America in 1911. The influence of Wright’s work up to 1910, known
through the Wasmuth publications, began to be evident in the later years of the First
World War. Dirk Roosenburg (1887-1962), Jan Wils (b. 1891), J. J. Van Loghem (1882-1940),
and several others were notably Wrightian in the early twenties; and the magazine
<i>Wendingen</i>, edited by H. T. Wijdeveld (b. 1885), continued through the mid twenties
to bring Wright’s later buildings and his projects of those years to European attention,
notably devoting to him a magnificent series of special issues in 1925 which constitutes
a document of signal importance for the study of his work of this period. The first
German book on Wright after the Wasmuth publications did not appear until the next
year, and the first in French only in 1928.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wrightian ideas were readily accepted by many Dutch architects previously inspired
chiefly by Berlage, not to speak of their influence on Berlage himself. Admiration for
Wright’s work undoubtedly played a real part in the rapid modulation of Dutch architecture
towards greater severity and a more geometrical discipline in the twenties.
But the major significance of the lively Dutch interest in the American lies in its effect
on the development of a few younger men in these years. To the Amsterdam School
there had arisen a strong opposition led by architects belonging to the De Stijl group of
artists who were active in Rotterdam and Utrecht. Yet the Amsterdam School architects
continued for some time to be highly productive, and the work of several prominent
men, notably J. F. Staal (1879-1940) and W. M. Dudok (b. 1884), was related to
both camps. But by the time Berlage was engaged on the big concrete-framed Netherlands
Insurance Company Building in The Hague in 1925-6 its very Wrightian character
had just been superseded in the projects and the production of Rietveld and Oud
by a more ascetic mode parallel to that adumbrated by the new architects of France and
Germany in the early twenties (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the new building of the Scandinavian countries before and after the First World
War admirers in other countries thought to recognize an originality and vitality comparable
to that of contemporary Dutch work. As has already been remarked, it has since become
evident that most of what was produced in these decades in Denmark and Sweden
did not really differ very much from the work of ‘traditionalists’ elsewhere. Despite extremely
elegant and often piquant stylization, comparable but superior to that of most
German work in this period, continued maintenance of inherited principles of design
and the general use of reminiscent detail sharply differentiated the characteristic production
of the Scandinavians from that of the Dutch, and of course far more from that of
Wright or Loos. What such men as Ragnar Östberg (1866-1945), and E. G. Asplund
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>(1885-1940) down to his sharp change of style in the late twenties, designed and built
in Sweden or P. V. Jensen Klint (1853-1930) and Kay Fisker (b. 1893)—down to his
parallel change of style—in Denmark was generally still rated ‘modern’ a generation
ago; almost all of it may now be more properly classed with ‘traditional’ work in other
countries. In quality, however, it often more than rivals all but the finest modern German,
Austrian, and Dutch work of its day (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>An exception to this statement as regards Sweden is the remarkable Engelbrekt
Church of 1904-14 in Stockholm by L. I. Wahlman (b. 1870), with its great parabolic
arches and its vertically massed exterior dominated by a very tall and svelte tower;
there much of the experimentalism of the nineties lived on. For its influence, this is
possibly a more important twentieth-century church than Perret’s at Le Raincy. An
even more considerable exception is a large part of the prolific production of the Finnish
architect Eliel Saarinen (1873-1950) both in the Old World and in the New. Saarinen
was the leading architect of Finland down to the twenties; after his removal to the
United States he was Wright’s only rival of his own generation on the American scene,
the careers of the early modern architects of the West Coast being by then in decline
(see Chapter <a href='#ch19'>19</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Saarinen’s earliest work in partnership with Herman Gesellius (1874-1916) and A. E.
Lindgren (1874-1929) dates from the nineties. In 1900 he designed the Finnish Pavilion
at the Paris Exhibition; this offered a powerful, though rather cranky, statement of
Nordic originality quite opposed to the Latin elegance of the contemporary Art
Nouveau and not without kinship to Berlage’s Amsterdam Exchange. At home important
public commissions followed rapidly: the National Museum in Helsinki in
1902 and the Helsinki railway station, for which he won the competition in 1904. This
large and complex structure, built over the years 1910-14, is Saarinen’s principal early
work. In size and in monumentality it rivals Bonatz’s Stuttgart station and also the vast
stations that ‘traditional’ architects in America were building at much the same time
(see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>). But there is much less of ‘tradition’ here than at the Stuttgart or,
<i>a fortiori</i>, in the American stations. The heaviness and the grandeur are more than a
little Germanic so that the fairest comparison is with Stürzenacker’s Karlsruhe station,
on the whole more straightforward in design and certainly much more delicately detailed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Saarinen’s achievement in his homeland made him well known throughout Europe;
as early as 1905 one of his principal works had been a country house, Molchow, in
Brandenburg in Germany. The project that he entered in the Chicago Tribune Tower
competition in 1922 brought him suddenly to American attention. Although a Gothic
design by John Mead Howells (b. 1868) and Raymond Hood (1881-1934) won this
competition and was executed<a id="r440"></a><a href='#f440' class='c025'><sup>[440]</sup></a> on Michigan Avenue, in 1923-5, Saarinen’s project
(which in any case received a financially generous second premium) had a tremendous
<i>succès d’estime</i>, including the accolade of Sullivan himself. In retrospect the design appears
almost as medievalizing as Howells &amp; Hood’s; but the elegance of the silhouette
and the consistency of the detailing, stylized nearly to the point of absolute originality,
had an enormous contemporary appeal.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>By this time Americans were beginning to grow bored with the increasingly forced
adaptation of familiar styles of the past to skyscraper design. Yet in 1922 they were
hardly ready to recognize the positive qualities of the very plain reticulated tower,
elaborated with certain minor Constructivist touches, that was proposed by Walter
Gropius (b. 1883) and Adolf Meyer (d. 1925) (Plate <a href='#pl158a'>158<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Today it is easy to see how
close this came to reviving the Chicago tradition of the early skyscrapers, a tradition
almost forgotten since the First World War, as also its great importance in the crystallization
of a new architecture in the early twenties (see Chapter <a href='#ch22'>22</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Saarinen, after settling in the United States in 1922, designed various other skyscrapers
along the lines of his Chicago project, none of them built. However, other architects
at once picked up his relatively novel ideas; and undoubtedly his ideas played an
important part in turning American skyscraper architects away from their long-continued
dependence on the styles of the past. Hood himself was not least affected, as
his black and gold American Radiator Building<a id="r441"></a><a href='#f441' class='c025'><sup>[441]</sup></a> on West 40th Street in New York,
completed in 1924 even before the Chicago Tribune Tower, soon made evident. In
Detroit, near which city Saarinen settled, Albert Kahn’s Fisher Building is even more
Saarinenesque and quite unrelated to his contemporary factories.</p>

<p class='c010'>Called to Bloomfield Hills, Mich., by the Booth publishing family, Saarinen’s first
work in America was the Cranbrook School for Boys, a very extensive group of buildings
begun in 1925. Here an almost Swedish elegance of craftsmanship and a profusion of
semi-traditional detail were combined in a somewhat whimsical manner rather recalling
English work of forty or fifty years earlier. The girls’ school near by, however, Kingswood,
begun in 1929, is much simpler, with an almost Wrightian horizontality and
crispness of expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>When American building activity revived in the late thirties Saarinen continued to
develop. From 1937 on his American-trained son Eero (1911-61), destined later to be one
of the leaders of post-war architecture in the United States, doubtless played some part
in encouraging that bolder structural expression and increasing sparseness of ornamentation
that characterizes his finest late works. These qualities are already very evident in
the Kleinhans Music Hall in Buffalo, N.Y., of 1938; while the contrast between the
straightforwardness of the Crow Island School in Winnetka, Ill., of 1939, on which the
Chicago firm of Perkins, Wheeler &amp; Will collaborated, and the quaintness and fussiness
of the Cranbrook School is quite startling.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most distinguished of all the late Saarinen works are his Tabernacle Church at
Columbus, Ind., designed in 1940 and built in 1941-2, and the similar but smaller Christ
Lutheran Church in Minneapolis that was built in 1949 just before his
death (Plate <a href='#pl157b'>157<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). Cool, clear, and rational, the
distinguished handling of brickwork in these churches, the knowing
control of light, and the careful ordering of space in the interiors
remain exemplary. Their towers are more refined versions of Moser’s on Sankt
Antonius in Basel; yet the massing of their blocky external elements almost seems to
belong to an earlier tradition, that of the English Victorian Gothic churches of the third
quarter of the nineteenth century, whose reminiscent forms they wholly abjure, and
with which neither of the Saarinens was probably familiar.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Of the first generation of modern architects not even Wright still survives. As long
as he continued in active production the story that the last four chapters have tried to
tell could not be completed but in 1959, with his death, an architectural epoch came
finally to an end. It was a rich epoch and a complex one because the men of that
generation were all great individualists and proud of it. In most countries they had to
fight a vigorous battle for the right to personal expression, a battle that they carried
through to recognition against entrenched inertia, both professional and lay. Yet in
general, the links of this generation with the later nineteenth century remained close,
both in their dependence on handicraft and in their frequent tendency—least evident
with Wright and Loos—to accept (up to a point) personal stylization of earlier architectural
forms<a id="r442"></a><a href='#f442' class='c025'><sup>[442]</sup></a> as a substitute for that basic originality of which all were at their best
truly capable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not since the late eighteenth century had there been any such wide international
renewal of architectural aspiration. Just as then, a new generation would profit from
the experiments of their elders, taking much from each, but rejecting much as well, in
order to create a style—or at least a discipline—aiming at universality. By its essential
principles, this discipline could not have the variety and the intensity of personal expression
which gives such colour and life to the work of the older men. Just as in the
early nineteenth century, however, the architects who succeeded the great originals
were far more able than they to work together. By joining their individual efforts the
men of the next generation changed the character of almost all architectural production
in a way that their elders were quite unable to do. Thus there came into being an
architecture more completely of its own century than any style-phase of the previous
hundred years—up to the Art Nouveau at least—had ever been wholly of the nineteenth
century.</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> project that Gropius and Meyer offered in the competition of 1922 for the Chicago
Tribune Tower, unlike Saarinen’s, attracted very little contemporary attention in
America (Plate <a href='#pl158a'>158<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Such a stripped expression of skeleton construction had, up to
that time in America, been seen only in factories and warehouses. Even in Chicago,
moreover, the New York ideal of the shaped tower had quite replaced the Sullivanian
slab as the favourite form for pretentious skyscrapers. Ten years later, however, when
the first International Exhibition of Modern Architecture was held at the new Museum
of Modern Art in New York it was evident that the kind of architecture represented by
Gropius’s project had become widely accepted in several European countries. By that
date it was even possible to deduce from the executed work of Gropius and his chief
European contemporaries, most of which was shown in the exhibition, the existence of
a new style christened ‘international’<a id="r443"></a><a href='#f443' class='c025'><sup>[443]</sup></a> by Alfred Barr, the Museum’s director. Whether
the new architecture that came into being in the twenties in Europe and has since spread
throughout the western world should in fact be considered a style, or even a style-phase,
remains a matter of controversy; but for forty years now it has been readily distinguishable
from what the older generation of modern architects produced.</p>
<p class='c010'>In 1922 this new architecture hardly existed except in the form of projects. Some of
the most strikingly novel buildings built in the early twenties were by Willem Marinus
Dudok (b. 1884) in Holland and by Erich Mendelsohn<a id="r444"></a><a href='#f444' class='c025'><sup>[444]</sup></a> (1887-1953) in Germany. These
no longer belonged to the realm of the earlier, pre-war modern architecture. Yet the
work of neither was as indicative of the direction the newer architecture was taking
in these formative years as is the Gropius Chicago Tribune project. Very shortly, however,
both Dudok and Mendelsohn drew closer to the main current of development
of this decade, although they continued to be, in varying degree, individualists rather
than whole-hearted converts to the dominant architectural mode of their generation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dudok’s work as City Architect of Hilversum, beginning with the Public
Baths and the Dr H. Bavinck School in 1921, is remarkably simple and
direct (Plate <a href='#pl157a'>157<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The abstract crispness and
clarity of his compositions are very different from the whimsically
curved surfaces of de Klerk’s and Kramer’s housing blocks
(Plate <a href='#pl156a'>156<span class='fss'>A</span></a> and <a href='#pl156b'><span class='fss'>B</span></a>). This rigidly geometrical
organization of the forms reflects his earlier contact with the group
of Dutch abstract artists known as <i>De Stijl</i>,<a id="r445"></a><a href='#f445' class='c025'><sup>[445]</sup></a> notably the
painters Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the sculptor Georges
Vantongerloo. But Dudok’s continued emphasis on the fine quality of
his brickwork, the massiveness of his characteristically interlocking
blocks, and a certain basically decorative intention still link his
buildings of the twenties at Hilversum with the ideals of the older
generation. Dudok’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>work of this period was certainly novel—and even modern in a very advanced way for
the date—but it remained quite Dutch in its idiosyncrasies, not ‘international’.</p>

<p class='c010'>The plasticity of Mendelsohn’s Einstein Tower, designed in 1919 and completed in
1921, at Neubabelsberg near Berlin (Plate <a href='#pl153b'>153<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) seems at first sight not unrelated to that
of Gaudí’s hewn-stone Casa Milá in Barcelona of 1905-10 (Plate <a href='#pl137a'>137<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But it was originally
intended to be executed in poured concrete—for technical reasons it is in fact mostly
of brick rendered with cement—and what one might call the ‘overtones’ of the forms
are more mechanistic than organic. Like Dudok, Mendelsohn had been influenced by a
local school of painting. But the images he distorted according to the tenets of Expressionism
came from the world of machines not, like Gaudí’s, from the world of plants
and animals. Mendelsohn’s earlier war-time sketches<a id="r446"></a><a href='#f446' class='c025'><sup>[446]</sup></a> make this origin even more
evident. The extreme point of this sort of abstract sculptural Expressionism<a id="r447"></a><a href='#f447' class='c025'><sup>[447]</sup></a> in the
twenties is found in the work of no architect but in the mountainous cult edifice called
the Goetheanum at Dornach in Switzerland, designed by the creator of anthroposophy
Rudolf Steiner<a id="r448"></a><a href='#f448' class='c025'><sup>[448]</sup></a> and begun in 1923.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mendelsohn himself rejected this excessively plastic approach to architecture—an
approach to which a reversion can be noted on the part of Le Corbusier in the last
decade, incidentally (Plate <a href='#pl167'>167</a>)—even before the Einstein Tower was completed.
The hat factory that he built at Luckenwalde in 1920-3 was in the direct line of descent
from the industrial work Behrens and Poelzig had done before the First World War.
This was rightly recognized as one of the signal productions of those crucial years of the
early twenties when the concepts of the new architecture were first being tentatively
realized in France and in Holland, and very shortly, of course in Germany. Dudok’s
buildings at Hilversum of the early twenties had a very considerable international
influence;<a id="r449"></a><a href='#f449' class='c025'><sup>[449]</sup></a> Mendelsohn’s Einstein Tower did not, at least not on architecture.<a id="r450"></a><a href='#f450' class='c025'><sup>[450]</sup></a> However,
other work of his done in the next few years was much admired and also widely
emulated, both in Germany and abroad, by the younger architects.</p>

<p class='c010'>In spite of the importance in these years of the executed work of Dudok and of Mendelsohn,
several other architects certainly had far more to do with determining the
direction that architecture took from 1922 on. One was a Swiss then working in Paris,
Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier. At this time more painter than
architect, Le Corbusier had earlier been an assistant of Perret’s and had also worked
briefly for Behrens and even for Josef Hoffmann. Two others were Dutchmen. J.J.P.
Oud had practised in association with Dudok at Leiden in 1912-13, and from 1917 and
1918 he and G.T. Rietveld were in much closer contact with the artists of <i>De Stijl</i> than
Dudok ever was, being actual members of that small cohesive group. Two more were
Germans, Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, both of whom had been
Behrens’s assistants, respectively for two and for three years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gropius, born in 1883, is the eldest of the five and older than Mendelsohn also; Le
Corbusier, Rietveld, and Mies were born in 1888; Oud in 1890. Gropius’s career began
as early as 1906, when he erected some plain brick workmen’s houses in Pomerania even
before he had finished his professional training at the Technische Hochschule in Munich.
A leading professor in this school was Theodor Fischer, Bonatz’s master, in whose office
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Oud later spent a few months in 1911. After a year of travel in Spain, Italy, and Holland
Gropius entered Behrens’s office in 1908, remaining there till 1910. On leaving Behrens
he designed in 1911, with Adolf Meyer, the Fagus Factory at Alfeld-an-der-Leine. He
worked again in partnership with Meyer from after the First World War until the
latter’s death in 1925.</p>

<p class='c010'>Directly as this Alfeld factory—it made shoe-lasts—follows from Behrens’s work
for the A.E.G., notably the front of the Turbine Factory of 1909, its architectural expression
is much more advanced (Plate <a href='#pl158b'>158<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). There the great window remained, for all
its size, but a window; here, in the main three-storey block, the slightly projecting metal
chassis rise unbroken over very wide areas bounded by narrow brick piers, and the
storey levels are barely indicated by solid panels identical in treatment with the glazed
sash above and below them. This arrangement of transparent and opaque elements
identically handled may almost—but not quite—be considered to constitute a ‘curtain-wall’.<a id="r451"></a><a href='#f451' class='c025'><sup>[451]</sup></a>
The omission of piers at the corners, a structural novelty here, enormously
enhances the effect of transparent volume as opposed to that of solid mass. In the
organization of the various industrial elements of the complete plant that are associated
with the glazed block there is neither symmetry, such as Behrens was only beginning
to relinquish, nor yet asymmetry of the more casual and picturesque sort; instead a
modular regularity controls the whole composition. This factory has long been recognized
historically as one of the most important<a id="r452"></a><a href='#f452' class='c025'><sup>[452]</sup></a> buildings of the twentieth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gropius’s next building, the Hall of Machinery at the Werkbund Exhibition of 1914
in Cologne, was in some ways less advanced. The main façades of this were quite symmetrical;
and in the articulation of the brick piers of the ground storey, in the heavily
framed central entrance and, above all, in the projecting slab roofs of the raised corners
there appears to have been some direct influence from the work of Wright, notably from
his hotel of 1909 in Mason City, Iowa. (This was published in the Wasmuth book of
1910, where Gropius would almost certainly have seen it.) The glazed front of the principal
storey, however, and especially the rounded glass stair-towers at the ends were not
at all Wrightian; they carried still further the expression of architecture as transparent
volume already evident in the Fagus Factory and approached very closely indeed the
mature curtain-wall concept, although at a modest scale.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mies remained with Behrens a year longer than Gropius, after having spent three
earlier years with Bruno Paul<a id="r453"></a><a href='#f453' class='c025'><sup>[453]</sup></a> (1874-1954), a more conservative architect whose best
work was done as a furniture designer. His independent career began in a much less
spectacular fashion than that of Gropius. The Perls house of 1911 at Zehlendorf outside
Berlin was as formally symmetrical as Behrens’s houses at Hagen of 1908-9 and rather
more Schinkelesque. The Urbig house of 1914 at Neubabelsberg was very correctly
late-eighteenth-century in its detailing. His most important work of these years, however,
was the project for the H. E. L. J. Kröller house in The Hague of 1912, intended to
contain the large and famous Kröller-Müller Collection of modern paintings now at
Otterlo. Of this a full-scale wood and canvas model was erected on the actual site, but
it was never built. The formal though asymmetrical organization of the severe horizontal
blocks, the incorporation of voids in the composition by means of loggias and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>pilastrades, and the cold austerity of the refined detailing of the masonry all approach
very closely such things by Schinkel as the Zivilcasino at Potsdam and Schloss Glienecke,
even if the characteristic belvedere tower of the latter is significantly omitted. In many
ways this project was as premonitory of later modern architecture as the Fagus Factory,
although the latter, as an executed building, has properly received much more notice.<a id="r454"></a><a href='#f454' class='c025'><sup>[454]</sup></a>
Both Gropius and Mies were involved in the First World War from 1914 to 1918, so
that the next stage in their careers opened only in 1919.</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Corbusier, Oud, and Rietveld were neutral nationals, but their production of these
early years, although less interrupted by the war, is mostly not of much intrinsic interest.
After two years with Perret in Paris Le Corbusier had spent six months in Behrens’s
office in 1910.<a id="r455"></a><a href='#f455' class='c025'><sup>[455]</sup></a> His first house,<a id="r456"></a><a href='#f456' class='c025'><sup>[456]</sup></a> built for his parents at La Chaux de Fond in Switzerland
in 1913, is more closely related to Behrens’s early houses in its plain white stucco
walls and fairly restricted fenestration than it is to the work of Perret or to Behrens’s
A.E.G. factories of 1909-11. The plan is the most interesting feature: this provides a
central living area out of which other more specialized rooms open to left and right
through wide glazed doors, a scheme that seems to derive from Perret’s planning, or
perhaps that of Loos,<a id="r457"></a><a href='#f457' class='c025'><sup>[457]</sup></a> rather than from Wright’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Corbusier’s next significant work was a war-time project of 1914-15 for low-cost
houses called Dom-Ino. These seem to derive not from anything of Perret’s or Behrens’s
but rather directly from the ones that Tony Garnier had proposed for his ‘Cité
Industrielle’ as early as 1901-4,<a id="r458"></a><a href='#f458' class='c025'><sup>[458]</sup></a> but they are still plainer, probably because of the concurrent
influence of Loos. However, Le Corbusier’s only important executed building
of the War years, the Villa Schwoff of 1916 at La Chaux de Fond, is closer to Perret in
its elaborate formality,<a id="r459"></a><a href='#f459' class='c025'><sup>[459]</sup></a> its much simplified academic detail, and its concrete-and-brick
construction. The plan represents an advance over that of his parents’ house, however,
for the main living area here is carried up two storeys and lighted by a tall window-wall
towards the garden. Of special significance also is the arrangement of all the flat
roofs as usable terraces.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next year, 1917, <i>De Stijl</i> was founded, and soon Oud and Rietveld as members
of the group began to collaborate with the Dutch abstract painters and sculptors generally
known as Neoplasticists.<a id="r460"></a><a href='#f460' class='c025'><sup>[460]</sup></a> In this year Oud built two villas by the seashore: Allegonda
at Katwijk, designed in association with the architect M. Kamerlingh Onnes; and
De Vonk at Noordwijkerhout, with interiors decorated by the <i>De Stijl</i> painter and
critic Theo van Doesburg. The Dutch had no direct contact with Behrens, unlike the
other three, but Oud was briefly with Fischer in Munich in 1911, as has been said. However,
Oud’s work down to this time had been essentially Berlagian: moreover, it was
Berlage who evoked his interest in the work of Wright. Nevertheless, there is nothing
Wrightian about these villas, but rather a Loos-like reduction of architecture to white
stucco cubes. The interest of De Vonk is largely confined to the floors of bold geometric
pattern executed in coloured tile by van Doesburg; Allegonda was much modified by
Oud in 1927. Rietveld was still primarily a furniture designer until 1921.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1918 Oud became City Architect of Rotterdam, where his brother occupied a
prominent political position, and began work at once on the Spangen Housing Estate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>Blocks I and II being of that year, Blocks VIII and IX of the next. The Tuschendijken
Estate followed in 1920. These housing blocks, even more than the seaside villas, are
notable for their negative rather than their positive qualities. All the elaboration of form
and detail of the Amsterdam School was put aside in favour of an ascetic regularity. But
various projects of these years illustrate how boldly Oud was attempting, partly under
the influence of his painter and sculptor friends, partly under that of Wright, to arrive
at new formal concepts. But Oud was not alone in these years in attempting to translate
the ideals of <i>De Stijl</i> into architecture. Gerrit Rietveld, in a jewellery shop in Amsterdam
built in 1921, was probably the first fully to realize Neoplasticist concepts in three
dimensions and at architectural scale.<a id="r461"></a><a href='#f461' class='c025'><sup>[461]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In Paris in the first post-war years Le Corbusier was also closely involved with
painters; indeed, he himself was then as much, or more, a painter as an architect, and
he has never ceased painting since. With the French painter Amédée Ozenfant he had
written a book on art, <i>Après le cubisme</i>, published in Paris in 1918; together they developed
a post-Cubist sort of abstract painting, partly inspired by their friend Fernand
Léger and partly by their interest in the simple shapes of everyday objects. This they
called ‘Purisme’. In support of their ideas about all the arts they began in 1920<a id="r462"></a><a href='#f462' class='c025'><sup>[462]</sup></a> to publish
a review, <i>L’Esprit nouveau</i>, which continued to appear until 1925, the nursery years
of the new architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>In succession to his Dom-Ino system of multiple housing of 1914-15, Le Corbusier was
developing at this time the Troyes system, using poured concrete, and also the Monol
system with a reinforced-concrete skeleton deriving technically from the innovations of
Perret. But the definitive formulation of his new ideals for architecture, focused as they
were at this time on the sociological problem of the low-cost dwelling, lay a year or
two ahead. Having no official position, he did not need, like Oud, to produce executed
work in quantity before his own concepts matured. Gropius’s earliest work, back in
1906, had been a low-cost housing scheme, as has been noted, and in 1911 he built another
housing estate, at Wittenberg-an-der-Elbe. Economical housing was increasingly recognized
as a social service for which architects ought to exploit to the utmost their technical
abilities; from the first it offered a common challenge to the Dutchman, the Swiss-Parisian,
and the German.</p>

<p class='c010'>Like the Dutch and Le Corbusier, Gropius was involved with painters in the early
post-war years. Appointed in 1919 head of the Art School in Weimar and also of the
Arts and Crafts School there which Van de Velde had run before the War, he combined
them and named the new school the Bauhaus.<a id="r463"></a><a href='#f463' class='c025'><sup>[463]</sup></a> Here teachers of painting and sculpture
and architecture worked in closest association with teachers of the crafts in continuation
and extension of the English Arts and Crafts ideals of the eighties and nineties. Soon this
rather Viennese approach, brought to the Bauhaus by Adolf Itten, with its emphasis on
handicraft, was revised by Gropius so that it might better fit an increasingly industrialized
society.<a id="r464"></a><a href='#f464' class='c025'><sup>[464]</sup></a> To his faculty Gropius brought such advanced painters as the German-American
Lyonel Feininger in 1919 and in 1922 the Russian Wassily Kandinsky and the
Swiss Paul Klee. Yet it was not their refined art but rather Expressionist painting and
sculpture which still influenced the jagged War Monument that he erected in Weimar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>in 1921. His architectural ideals in the early post-war years before 1922, moreover, seem
to have been rather closer to Poelzig’s or Mendelsohn’s than to those of Le Corbusier,
Oud, or Rietveld.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As has been several times stated already, certain remarkable projects best displayed the
direction in which several of the architects of the younger generation were moving,
along nearly parallel lines, in these years preceding the general revival of building production
in the mid twenties. Gropius’s Chicago Tribune project of 1922, in which the
line of his development shifted away from Expressionism, has already been discussed out
of sequence (Plate <a href='#pl158a'>158<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). But the most significant projects, earlier than this by several
years, were by Mies and by Le Corbusier. Mies’s early work had not been very adventurous
up to the time when he proposed, in 1919 and in 1920-1, two revolutionary
glazed skyscrapers to be built in Berlin. In both, the floors were to be cantilevered out
from central supporting cores and the curtain-walls enclosing them merely light metal
chassis holding great panes of glass. However, their plans, respectively jagged and curvilinear,
reflected the strong influence of Expressionism, an influence that disappeared
from Mies’s as from Gropius’s work the very next year, after the Germans became
aware of the architectural implications of Dutch Neoplasticism and also of Russian Constructivism.
Van Doesburg,<a id="r465"></a><a href='#f465' class='c025'><sup>[465]</sup></a> it should be noted, visited the Bauhaus in 1922, and for a
short but crucial period both Gropius and Mies seem to have drawn from Dutch sources
as much inspiration as the young Dutch architects. In addition to the obvious debts of
Dudok, Oud, and Rietveld to Neoplasticism, Cornelis van Eesteren (b. 1897), today
City Architect of Amsterdam, was actually collaborating with van Doesburg in these
years on various house projects.</p>

<p class='c010'>Less striking than Mies’s skyscrapers, but more buildable, were Le
Corbusier’s successive Citrohan projects for houses of 1919-22
(Plate <a href='#pl160a'>160<span class='fss'>A</span></a>; Figures 44 and 45). Brought to public attention
first in <i>L’Esprit nouveau</i> and later in his extremely
influential book <i>Vers une architecture</i>, published in Paris in
1923 and shortly translated into English and
German, these adumbrated a new aesthetic of architecture more completely than anything
that he or any other architect had yet proposed on paper, much less built.
Modest in size, each Citrohan house was to consist largely of a two-storey living-room
fronted like that of the La Chaux de Fond house of 1916 with a tall window-wall.
This would occupy most of the façade, and it was here set within a very plain frame of
rendered concrete. The dining area was to be at the rear under a balcony from which
the bedroom would open. Thus the section is similar to Wright’s Millard house of 1923.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>The earlier version of the house was intended to
stand on the ground (Figure <a href='#i368'>44</a>); in the later scheme the
whole cube of the house was to be lifted up on <i>pilotis</i>,
that is, free-standing piers of reinforced concrete constituting,
Perret-like, essential parts of the structural
skeleton (Plate <a href='#pl160a'>160<span class='fss'>A</span></a>; Figure 45). Like Sullivan’s piers
at the base of the Guaranty Building of 1894-5 (Plate #119:pl119)
the effect of these <i>pilotis</i>, allowing circumambient
space to pass under the enclosed building above, was
to enhance very strongly the look of volume as opposed
to mass. This treatment, possible only with skeleton
construction in ferro-concrete, steel, or wood, soon
became one of the most significant formal devices
differentiating the new architecture of the twenties from
what preceded it. The later Citrohan project was thus
the first of the ‘boxes on stilts’ against which Wright
continually protested, even though his own buildings
themselves tended more and more frequently to be
lifted off the ground by one means or another.</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 45. Le Corbusier:<br />Second project for<br />Citrohan house, 1922,<br />plans and section</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>If the structural methods employed here by Le Corbusier
came from Perret, the external expression of his
lifted box seems rather to derive from Garnier or Loos,
although the rendered surfaces were evidently intended
to be smoother and flatter than those of Loos’s executed
houses (Plate <a href='#pl155a'>155<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) and the pattern of the windows
much more regularly organized in the wall-plane. With
the roof terrace on top surrounded by parapets continuous
with the wall-planes below, even the earlier
type is apprehended as volume rather than mass,
especially as there were no deep window reveals to
suggest thickness in the walls such as appear in Garnier’s
projects and Loos’s executed work. By keeping the
openings absolutely in the wall-plane, as Hoffmann
had done on the Stoclet house, the very exact geometrical
discipline of the design of the façades could
be maintained even when seen in perspective. As a
result, however, the underlying structure was expressed
only in the <i>pilotis</i> of the later project. Yet the wide
expanse of the window-wall at the front and the
characteristic shape of the other windows, oblongs
extended horizontally,<a id="r466"></a><a href='#f466' class='c025'><sup>[466]</sup></a> would obviously not have
been practical but for the long spans made possible by
the ferro-concrete skeleton.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>There was in the Citrohan projects no very close similarity to Le Corbusier’s Purist
pictures of these years other than the crisply geometrical ordering of the very flat façades
and the untextured smoothness of their surfaces. However, the extreme mechanical
precision and the more-than-Loosian rejection of the inessential clearly reflected an
aesthetic parallel to that adumbrated in his paintings. Certainly the effect was—as Wright
and others recurrently complained—likely to prove more pictorial than architectonic
when such things were executed. There was no ornament such as Oud had, in some
sense, obtained at Katwijk from his painter-collaborator van Doesburg; indeed, there
was hardly any detail at all, at least as architectural detail was understood by Perret and
Behrens. In this respect also Le Corbusier’s new architecture was closest to the personal
style of Loos.</p>

<p class='c010'>Articles in <i>L’Esprit nouveau</i> and later the illustrations in <i>Vers une architecture</i> revealed
the sources of Le Corbusier’s extra-architectural inspiration and made such inspiration
available to others who cared to look about them with his particular vision and his
clearly defined ideals for the modern world. Works of engineering, American grain-elevators
and the like;<a id="r467"></a><a href='#f467' class='c025'><sup>[467]</sup></a> the forms of things that move—ocean liners, motor cars and
aeroplanes:<a id="r468"></a><a href='#f468' class='c025'><sup>[468]</sup></a> such things provided some of the visual prototypes for Le Corbusier’s new
aesthetic of architecture.<a id="r469"></a><a href='#f469' class='c025'><sup>[469]</sup></a> But there was also the social motive of developing a method
of building houses to satisfy the needs of all classes. Moreover, Le Corbusier was already—to
use a term introduced later—as much a ‘planner’ as an architect. In 1922 he prepared
a project for a city of three million inhabitants. This proposed at the core a
geometrically ordered group of widely spaced cruciform skyscrapers and, round the
core, ranges of blocks of flats of moderate height, not arranged along narrow streets,
but broadly distributed over a park-like terrain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Corbusier had many years to wait before the world caught up with his ideas as a
planner as these were promulgated in his book <i>Urbanisme</i>, published in Paris in 1925.
But as an architect<a id="r470"></a><a href='#f470' class='c025'><sup>[470]</sup></a> he was shortly building in and near Paris a series of houses, most
of them of considerably greater size than his Citrohan project. Moreover, in 1927, at
the Werkbund Exhibition in Stuttgart, he finally brought that to execution also,
although some minor modifications were incorporated.<a id="r471"></a><a href='#f471' class='c025'><sup>[471]</sup></a> Le Corbusier’s very first post-war
houses—one at Vaucresson, S.-et-O., near Paris, which has been remodelled quite
beyond recognition, and the house for Ozenfant at 53 Avenue Reille in the Montrouge
district of Paris, both designed in 1922 and built in 1923—were naturally not very
adequate expressions of his ideals<a id="r472"></a><a href='#f472' class='c025'><sup>[472]</sup></a> (Figure <a href='#i371'>46</a>). But, beginning with the contiguous La
Roche and Jeanneret houses, designed originally in 1922 also and executed with many
modifications and improvements in 1924 in the Square du Dr Blanche in the Auteuil
district of Paris, and culminating in the Savoye house at Poissy, S.-et-O., of 1929-30
(Plate <a href='#pl159'>159</a>), the new aesthetic<a id="r473"></a><a href='#f473' class='c025'><sup>[473]</sup></a> of the Citrohan project was exploited with increasing
virtuosity. Le Corbusier developed much further the spatial unity of his plans, usually
keeping inside a defining rectangle but articulating that in various ways: at the Savoye
house, for example, the main terrace is within the same raised box as the enclosed rooms
(Figure <a href='#i372'>47</a>). The treatment of the exteriors likewise grew simpler and more open.
Horizontal windows were grouped and extended to form continuous ribbons all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>way across façades, and roofs at various levels, being completely flat, served as outdoor
living-spaces. This is best seen at Les Terrasses (Plate <a href='#pl160b'>160<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), the house built in 1927 for
Michael Stein at 17 Rue du Professeur Pauchet in Garches, S.-et-O.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Different colours were often used on different walls to emphasize them as individual
planes, particularly in interiors. Curved elements, such as were introduced earlier in the
plan of the Vaucresson house (Figure <a href='#i371'>46</a>), appeared at the Savoye house in screens that
rose around the upper roof-terrace (Plate <a href='#pl159'>159</a>). Moreover, the geometrical discipline of
his <i>tracés régulateurs</i> based on the Golden Section was used with ever-increasing consistency.<a id="r474"></a><a href='#f474' class='c025'><sup>[474]</sup></a>
At the same time the use of different colours and of curves produced, particularly
at the Savoye house, a lyricism closely related to that of Purist paintings of the
early twenties. This is curious, since in his paintings dating from the late twenties Le
Corbusier was moving away from Purism, under the influence of Fernand Léger (and
perhaps even of Surrealism), towards a looser and more connotative mode.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Le Corbusier was not the only architect of the new generation building houses in
Paris in these years. Beside his, those by the Belgian Robert Mallet-Stevens (b. 1886)<a id="r475"></a><a href='#f475' class='c025'><sup>[475]</sup></a>
are at once cruder and more superficial in their design. In the Rue Mallet-Stevens near
Le Corbusier’s La Roche and Jeanneret houses, where he built several houses close together
in 1926-7, he provided a somewhat depressing glimpse of the future, a glimpse
which has often proved, alas, to be only too accurate a generation later. The Cité Seurat,
on the other side of Paris near Le Corbusier’s Ozenfant house, offered an even larger
group of new houses of the same period, several of them of much higher quality. The
Chana Orloff house there is by Perret; but most of the others are by André Lurçat<a id="r476"></a><a href='#f476' class='c025'><sup>[476]</sup></a>
(b. 1892), an architect of much more integrity than Mallet-Stevens, if without Le Corbusier’s
genius. The best of Lurçat’s houses, where they have been adequately maintained,
possess certain common-sense virtues that Le Corbusier’s lack; in the late twenties
and early thirties they provided paradigms at least as popular as Le Corbusier’s. His school
of 1931 in Villejuif, Seine, has a special importance also, as it was in the field of school-building<a id="r477"></a><a href='#f477' class='c025'><sup>[477]</sup></a>
that the new architecture first became widely accepted later in the thirties in
several countries. Le Corbusier’s activity was much greater than Lurçat’s, however, and
in one major project at least he extended the scope of the new architecture far beyond
the realm of the modest private dwellings that he and Lurçat were so largely restricted
to building in the twenties.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1925, in the Pavilion de l’Esprit Nouveau at the Paris Exposition des Arts Décoratifs,
Le Corbusier had shown a dwelling unit of the Citrohan type arranged as a flat with
a large terrace at one side, following an unexecuted project of 1922. The actual housing
estate that he built at Pessac outside Bordeaux in 1925-6 was less successful, although by
this time many young architects concerned with housing in other countries were finding
inspiration in his work and perhaps even more in his ideas. But it was in an entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>different realm that Le Corbusier had, like Saarinen in the Chicago Tribune competition,
a failure which was nonetheless a tremendous <i>succès d’estime</i>. Le Corbusier’s
project for the Palace of the League of Nations<a id="r478"></a><a href='#f478' class='c025'><sup>[478]</sup></a> came very close to winning the
competition of 1927. Moreover, the totally undistinguished scheme jointly produced
by the elderly Frenchman P.-H. Nénot (1853-1934), who had built the new Sorbonne
in Paris in 1884-9, and various other architects from several different countries eventually
executed in Geneva never received the attention or the flattery of world-wide
emulation and imitation which Le Corbusier’s project did. This led, for example, to his
selection to design the Centrosoyus in Moscow in 1928. Begun the following year, this
was finally finished in 1936, but with most inadequate supervision. However, the Communist
‘party line’<a id="r479"></a><a href='#f479' class='c025'><sup>[479]</sup></a> turned sharply against modern architecture in the early thirties,
and no more projects by Western European architects were invited after the Palace of
the Soviets competition held in 1931.</p>

<p class='c010'>If Le Corbusier in the twenties was, by force of circumstances, almost more completely
restricted to house-building than Wright had been in the preceding decades,
Gropius’s career in Germany developed very differently. In 1925 he was invited by the
city of Dessau to come there from Weimar and re-establish the Bauhaus; in that year
and the next he had a chance to build a very large and complex structure to house
the school as well as his own and several other professors’ houses. The houses were
not notable additions to the new canon, although they were soon as much imitated
as Le Corbusier’s and Lurçat’s. However, the Bauhaus building itself was the first
major example of the new architecture to be executed, illustrating on a large scale
most of its possibilities and principal themes, none of them by this date altogether
novel.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most striking element of the Bauhaus is the studio block, a four-storeyed glass
box (Plate <a href='#pl161a'>161<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). This carried to its logical limit the implications of the near-curtain-wall
of the Fagus Factory, quite as Mies had already proposed for his two glass skyscraper
projects, but without their Expressionist planning. The bridge to the left of this block
exploits the possibilities of great spans in ferro-concrete construction. Throughout that
section and the block on the left ribbon-windows longer than Le Corbusier’s at Les
Terrasses open up the walls just as Mies had already proposed to do in a notable project
of 1922 for a ferro-concrete office building. A lower refectory wing links the glazed
block with an apartment tower at the rear; in that the grouping of the horizontal windows
with the many little projecting balconies clearly expresses the fact that this portion
of the building is made up of small repeated dwelling units.</p>

<p class='c010'>The organization of this very complex structure is asymmetrical but carefully studied
(Figure <a href='#i374'>48</a>). Where Le Corbusier had thus far composed most of his houses inside a
single ‘box’, Gropius here combined four or more. In each he emphasized visually the
fact that the surface was but a thin shell enclosing an internal volume, but he varied the
treatment according to the internal use of each portion of the building. At the same time
regularity of rhythm, and often identity of measure in the parts, ordered the whole
without recourse to symmetry or to the imposition of any such special system of proportion
as Le Corbusier was enthusiastically developing.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Gropius did not again, until late in life in America, have such another architectural
opportunity. In the following years, down to his departure from Germany with the rise
of Hitler, his production was almost entirely in the field of low-cost housing. There he
had the large-scale responsibilities largely denied to Le Corbusier until after the Second
World War, but common enough by then in Germany.<a id="r480"></a><a href='#f480' class='c025'><sup>[480]</sup></a> First, in 1926-8, came the
Törten Estate at Dessau consisting of terrace houses of concrete with smoothly rendered
walls and horizontal windows. These were sound and economical but somewhat dull in
design, the very reverse of Le Corbusier’s at Pessac. At the Werkbund Exhibition of 1927,
moreover, Gropius’s free-standing houses did not rival Le Corbusier’s in quality of design,
despite their considerable technical importance as early examples of something
approaching total prefabrication.</p>

<div id='i374'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='c003'>Figure 48. Walter Gropius: Dessau, Bauhaus, 1925-6, plans</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Gropius’s most finished works of the twenties were all at Dessau. Besides the Bauhaus
itself, there is a small block of flats rising at the end of a row of one-storey shops to form
the centre of the Törten Estate of 1928. But even more notable is the Dessau City Employment
Office, begun the year before. Here Gropius rejected stucco rendering,<a id="r481"></a><a href='#f481' class='c025'><sup>[481]</sup></a>
hitherto almost as much the sign manual of the new architecture in Germany as in
France, and surfaced his walls with brick (Plate <a href='#pl161b'>161<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The horizontal strips of window
in the office wing, carefully related to the narrow bands of wall between and elegantly
subdivided by light metal sash, are balanced with bold assurance against the tall vertical
light of the stair tower at one end. Whether Gropius had learned from the Neoplasticists
or the Constructivists, by this time he had become a master of abstract architectural
composition in his own right.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaving the Bauhaus in 1928, Gropius next undertook a large housing estate,
Dammerstock, at Karlsruhe. Here he combined terrace houses, somewhat ampler in size
and less mechanically designed than those at Törten, with ranges of six-storey blocks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>flats in the form of long, rigidly orientated slabs. Following this came the Siemensstadt
Estate of 1930 outside Berlin (Plate <a href='#pl162a'>162<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). This is the classic example of housing in tall,
thin slabs, prototype of innumerable similar estates to be built throughout the western
world before and after the Second World War. In Germany, however, where the form
was first adumbrated, their production ceased in 1933 with the onset of the Hitler
regime—it has since been revived very actively, particularly by Ernst May at Hamburg
and by architects of several countries in the Interbau exhibition of 1957 in Berlin.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mies in the twenties was not nearly so prolific as Gropius, nor was he so widely influential.
His Wolf house of 1926 at Guben and the Lange and Esters houses at Krefeld
of 1926 and 1928, side by side in the Wilhelmshofallee, despite their fine dark brickwork<a id="r482"></a><a href='#f482' class='c025'><sup>[482]</sup></a>
and the careful placing of the large horizontal windows, did not redeem the promise
of an earlier project which he had made in 1922 for a country house; that was comparable
in significance to his skyscraper schemes of the preceding years. Its plan seemed
to represent the extension upward of a complex, but very rigid, geometrical pattern like
those seen in Mondriaan’s and van Doesburg’s paintings of this period (Figure <a href='#i375'>49</a>). This
sort of planning allowed a continuous flow of space in and around internal partitioning
elements and out through wall-high glass areas to the surrounding terraces, themselves
defined by the extension of the solid brick walls of the house. This openness more
than rivalled, and was probably influenced by, the spatial flow in the Prairie Houses of
Wright. Neoplasticist influence continued strong in Mies’s work as late as his Liebknecht-Luxemburg
Monument in Berlin of 1926. This was an abstract rectangular
block, ingeniously composed of various brick surfaces arranged in different planes. (It
was, of course, destroyed under Hitler.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The flats that Mies built in the Afrikanische Strasse in Berlin in 1924-5 were more in
line with Gropius’s and Le Corbusier’s contemporary work than his private houses.
Moreover, his block of flats (Plate <a href='#pl162b'>162<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) at the Werkbund Exhibition of 1927 on the
Weissenhof at Stuttgart, of which he was the general director, with its lines of broad
window-bands broken occasionally by vertical stair-windows, had an elasticity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>planning and a clarity and subtlety of expression much superior to Gropius’s taller and
longer slabs at Dammerstock and Siemensstadt.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1929 came Mies’s masterpiece, one of the few buildings by which the twentieth
century might wish to be measured against the great ages of the past (Plate <a href='#pl165a'>165<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The
German Pavilion at the Barcelona Exhibition, although built of permanent materials—steel,
glass, marble, and travertine—was, like most exhibition buildings, only temporary.
But few structures have come to be so widely known after their demolition, or so intensely
admired through reproductions, except perhaps Paxton’s Crystal Palace. Set on
a raised travertine base almost like a Greek stylobate, in which lies an oblong reflecting
pool, the space within the pavilion was defined by no bounding walls at all but solely
by the rectangle of its thin roof-slab. This was supported, almost immaterially, on a few
regularly spaced metal members of delicate cruciform section sheathed in chromium.
The covered area was subdivided, rather in the manner of the project of 1922 for a brick
country house, by tall plate-glass panels carried in light metal chassis, some transparent,
some opaque, and also by screens of highly polished marble standing apart from the
metal supports. The disposition of these screens is asymmetrical but exquisitely ordered;
yet it has none of that Neoplasticist complexity evident in the placing of the partitioning
elements in the project of 1922. As a result, the articulated space of the pavilion has a
classic serenity quite unlike the more dynamically flowing interiors of Wright’s houses.
At the Berlin Building Exhibition in 1931 Mies repeated the Barcelona Pavilion in less
sumptuous materials, making only slight changes in the plan so that it might provide a
model for a house.</p>

<p><span class='c003'>Figure 50. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe: Brno, Tugendhat house, 1930, plan</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>More than a little of the special quality of space-distribution in this exhibit Mies had
been able to achieve already in the Tugendhat house of 1930 at Brno in Czechoslovakia.
There also the screens that subdivide the unified living-space are quite separate
from the delicate cruciform metal supports (Figure <a href='#i376'>50</a>). One of them, made of macassar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>ebony, partially encloses the dining-area and is semicircular in plan, thus notably enriching
the general spatial effect. Externally this house is less remarkable. At the upper,
or entrance, level towards the street it is quite closed in and even rather forbidding; but
at the rear towards the garden there is a continuous, room-high glass wall framed by
stucco bands above and below. At one end an open terrace is included within the rectangle
of the plan, and from this a broad flight of stone stairs descends to the ground.
The contrast with the somewhat similar rear of Le Corbusier’s Les Terrasses expresses
well the considerable range of different effects possible within the tight limits of the new
architecture even in this, its most rigidly doctrinaire period of the late twenties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Within the twenties, both in France and in Germany, the new architecture received
its full formulation, first in projects and shortly afterwards in executed work. At the
same time Le Corbusier and Gropius provided in articles and in books the arguments in
its defence.<a id="r483"></a><a href='#f483' class='c025'><sup>[483]</sup></a> Both are extremely articulate men, the one with the emotional intensity of
a poet or a preacher, the other with the cool logic of a scientist or a professor. They
soon found excited readers and later devoted followers all over the western world as their
writings were exported, translated,<a id="r484"></a><a href='#f484' class='c025'><sup>[484]</sup></a> and paraphrased; but the significant activity of this
period was by no means only French and German. Despite the continuing vitality of
the Amsterdam School through the mid twenties, the new Dutch school associated with
Rotterdam rose rapidly in national and international significance. Oud,<a id="r485"></a><a href='#f485' class='c025'><sup>[485]</sup></a> indeed,
brought the new architecture to maturity in Holland in precisely the same years as Le
Corbusier and their German contemporaries; Rietveld and several others made signal
contributions also, in Rietveld’s case perhaps equal in importance to Oud’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Oud Mathenesse housing estate at Rotterdam, which Oud undertook in 1922, is
rather different from Spangen and Tuschendijken. At first sight it may appear more conservative,
since it consists of small terrace houses with visible tiled roofs rather than tall
blocks of flats. But rendered and painted walls replaced the brick of the earlier Rotterdam
work, recalling the Loos-like treatment of his seaside villas as also the rather
Wrightian projects he had designed in the intervening years. Moreover, the shapes and
subdivisions of the windows were very carefully considered, so that the general effect is
quite similar to the most advanced projects of Le Corbusier and of Mies designed
in this same year. The influence of the <i>De Stijl</i> artists may not be very apparent in the
façades of the houses and shops; but in the temporary building superintendent’s office
that Oud built here in 1923 cubical wooden elements painted in primary colours produced
a composition quite like a Neoplasticist painting developed in three dimensions.
It should be noted, however, that this was not, like Dudok’s work of the period, at all
related to the very complex Neoplasticist sculpture of Vantongerloo. Oud’s façade
of 1925 for the Café de Unie in Rotterdam, being two-dimensional, was even more like
a Mondrian painting raised to architectural scale.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has already been mentioned that in 1923 van Doesburg was engaged in collaboration
with van Eesteren on some remarkable studies, half abstract paintings, half architectural
isometrics. Rietveld, in the Schroeder house of 1924 in Utrecht (Plate <a href='#pl164b'>164<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), boldly
carried such a hypothetical Neoplasticist architecture of discrete planes and structural lines
into the world of reality even more completely than in his earlier shop in Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>But by this time, Oud felt he had learned what Neoplasticism had to offer him. He
was in any case now personally closer to Mondrian than to van Doesburg, and Mondrian
had left Holland for Paris. In Oud’s first really mature work, which remains also
his masterpiece, two terraces with shops at their ends built at the Hook of Holland in
1926-7 but designed a year or two earlier, all overt emulation of contemporary painting
disappeared, except for the restriction of colour to white-painted rendering with only
small touches of the primaries on some of the minor elements of wood and metal
(Plate <a href='#pl163b'>163<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The serenity of these smooth façades with their long regular ranges of
horizontal windows, the extreme refinement of the detailing of the fences and the
doorways, and, above all, the lyricism of the rounded shops, their walls all of glass
under a cantilevered slab bent down at the ends, were unequalled by anything Le
Corbusier or Gropius or Mies had yet built. Reputedly it was the influence of Van de
Velde that led Oud to introduce curves here, much to the disgust of the Neoplasticists.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oud’s terrace-houses in the 1927 exhibition at Stuttgart were equally exemplary in
their perfection of finish but slightly less interesting in their over-all design. Those by
a still younger Dutch architect, Mart Stam (b. 1899), were perhaps superior. Then there
followed Oud’s very large Kiefhoek housing project at Rotterdam which was built
in 1928-30. Here the windows of the upper storey of each terrace became a continuous
band, but something of the earlier refinement was lost just as in Gropius’s Siemensstadt
blocks of the same period.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Kiefhoek Oud was called on to provide a church as well as housing. Its vices as
well as its virtues epitomize very well the state of the new architecture at the end of the
decade (Plate <a href='#pl164a'>164<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Considered as elements in an abstract composition, the handling
of the subordinate features of the Kiefhoek church is masterly, refining and—as it were—domesticating
various adjuncts of an almost industrial order such as had earlier provided
a good part of the varied visual interest of Gropius’s Fagus Factory. But the main
auditorium block is so box-like that it holds its place among the rows of houses only by
its size, offering no expression whatsoever of its special purpose—it could as easily be a
garage. A far more notable exemplar of the new architecture, still about the finest
twentieth-century building in Holland, is the van Nelle Factory outside Rotterdam built
in 1927-8 by the firm of J. A. Brinkman (1902-49) and L. C. van der Vlugt (b. 1894) but
probably designed by Stam (Plate <a href='#pl163a'>163<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The Dutch firm of B. Bijvoet (b. 1889) and
Johannes Duiker (1890-1935) should also be mentioned for their admirable work of
the twenties, starting with several Wrightian houses of 1924 at Kijkduin, but soon
quite as advanced as Oud’s or Rietveld’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>The conditions of the twenties—or more precisely the particular conditions under
which the new architects had to work and, to a large extent, even seemed satisfied to
work—restricted their scope rather considerably. In France the usual clients, often
American rather than French, sought houses that were <i>avant-garde</i> and related ideologically
to the painting of the Cubists and Post-Cubists. Towards the utilitarian field of low-cost
housing the new architects everywhere felt a special responsibility; in Germany and
Holland they readily found major opportunities for official employment at such work.
Their intense concern with the aesthetic potentialities of engineering gave them a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>special sympathy for industrial building, but major opportunities such as the van Nelle
Factory were very rare. Gropius’s Bauhaus, a large and complex structure serving a
cultural purpose, and the Barcelona Pavilion, an edifice with almost no other purpose
than to be beautiful, were important exceptions in a range of production characterized
by a surprising international consistency of type as well as of character.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet the hands of the various individual architects are, in fact, never difficult to distinguish
and, from this time onwards, the paths of the four early leaders began definitely
to diverge. It was chiefly the work of late-comers, of whom there were in the twenties
large numbers only in Germany, that tended towards monotony and anonymity. Not
since the early years of the nineteenth century, when Romantic Classicism at the hands
of a second generation reached a comparable clarity of stylistic definition, had there
been such a rigid and humbly accepted architectural discipline. However, certain men,
such as Mendelsohn and Dudok, retained in their practice of the new architecture
strong traces of earlier idiosyncrasies. Much of their work lacks therefore the purity and
the assured mastery of the four initiators. But Mendelsohn’s Schocken Department
Stores, built in several German cities in the late twenties—at Nuremberg and Stuttgart
in 1926-7, at Chemnitz in 1928—and his Petersdorf Store at Breslau in 1927 are certainly
superior in interest and in vitality to the new city houses and suburban villas in France;
not to speak of the housing estates in Germany that were being produced in such considerable
quantity by the end of the decade by architects who were literalistic adherents
of the new architecture. The work of such designers showed all the naive enthusiasm,
the subjection to discipline, and the doctrinaire characteristics of the activity of new
converts in any field.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when, in his Columbus Haus of 1929-31 in Berlin, Mendelsohn finally accepted
a comparable discipline he was able to retain most of his earlier vitality. Here he produced
a really paradigmatic commercial building—almost a small skyscraper—such as
none of the four leaders ever had the opportunity of carrying to execution in the twenties.
Much the same can be said for a considerably later ‘baby skyscraper’, Dudok’s
Erasmus Huis of 1939-40 in the Coolsingel in Rotterdam. This is still, after the van
Nelle Factory, one of the best buildings in Rotterdam, despite all the post-war reconstruction
there (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>As the new architecture spread to other countries around 1930 it was naturally the
lowest common denominator of its potentialities that became most widely evident.
However, at just this point an international depression supervened; the building
boom, with which the rise of the new architecture had been at best but coincidentally
associated, soon ground to a standstill. In Germany in the early thirties, moreover, as
also in Russia and considerably later and less rigidly in Italy, an authoritarian regime proscribed
the new architecture. Leaders like Gropius, Mies, and Mendelsohn left the
country and the new architecture was in abeyance there until after Hitler’s fall.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Historians</span>, whether of politics or the arts, should ideally stand at some distance

forced to do, of events concerning which he has first-hand knowledge—and hence,
alas, first-hand prejudices. Architects, the real actors in architectural history, often write
as well as build; since Vitruvius there have been many whose fame depends as much on
their books as on their buildings, not least several of the men with whom Part Three of
this book has dealt. But those who write about architecture as historians and critics
without being active builders, who merely explain, select, and illustrate the significant
work of their own day or even of the past—particularly the immediate past—are to
some extent minor actors on the scene also. They cannot, therefore, be merely neutral
observers, reporting without <i>parti pris</i> the ideas and the achievements of others, however
hard they may try to maintain their objectivity.</p>
<p class='c010'>To have written the only monograph on Wright to appear in French, to have provided
the first account in English of the new architecture, to have published a book on
the work of Oud in the late twenties, modest as these contributions were, are all actions
indicating an early commitment on the part of this author. The preparation in 1931
with Philip Johnson of the first International Exhibition of Modern Architecture, held
at the Museum of Modern Art in 1932, in which Le Corbusier, Gropius, Oud, and Mies
were signalized as the leaders of the new architecture, and the publication—also with
Philip Johnson—of the book called <i>The International Style</i><a id="r486"></a><a href='#f486' class='c025'><sup>[486]</sup></a> at that time were even more
definite and controversial acts of participation in the dialectic of architectural development
in this century.</p>

<p class='c010'>If it seems necessary to mention these publications here and not merely to refer to
them in the Notes or list them in the Bibliography, it is in no spirit of boastfulness but
rather of apology. From this point on the ideal objectivity of the historian, attempting
disinterestedly to piece the past together from a study of its extant monuments and
from relevant contemporary documents, is inevitably coloured, if not cancelled out, by
the subjectivity of the critic writing of events he knew at first hand. Concerning them,
of course, his present opinions have no more real historical validity than those he held
and published nearer the time when the events occurred. With this proviso the canvas
may now be somewhat broadened.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the early thirties the new architecture was by no means restricted to France, Germany,
and Holland, the countries where it had originated. Yet, with the possible exception
of Alvar Aalto (b. 1898) in Finland, no other leader of the calibre of the early four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>had appeared up to that time. The building of 1928-9 at Turku for the newspaper <i>Turun
Sanomat</i> was Aalto’s first mature work to be completed. In this the plastic handling of
the concrete piers<a id="r487"></a><a href='#f487' class='c025'><sup>[487]</sup></a> in the interior introduced a new and personal note of architectural
expression in a frankly industrial setting. His Tuberculosis Sanatorium at Paimio of
1929-33 rivalled the Bauhaus in size, if not perhaps in complexity, and was almost the
first<a id="r488"></a><a href='#f488' class='c025'><sup>[488]</sup></a> major demonstration of the special applicability of the new architecture to hospitals.
The City Library at Viipuri, designed as early as 1927 but not finished until 1935,
was a more original example of the new architecture. In particular, the lecture hall
there, with its acoustic ceiling of irregularly wavy section made up of strips of wood, was
strikingly novel.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the United States the Lovell house in Los Angeles opened in 1929 the American
career of Richard J. Neutra (b. 1892), an Austrian who had worked briefly with Wright.
In this house, with its cantilevers, its broad areas of glass, and its volumetric composition,
Neutra showed the completeness with which he had already rejected the broad
Wrightian road and accepted the more restricted aspirations of the newer architecture of
Europe. Never, perhaps, have Wright’s ideals and those of the next generation appeared
so sharply opposed as at just this time, moreover. But Neutra’s mature work began only
considerably later than this.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1930-2 the tallest of all skyscrapers, the Empire State Building by Shreve, Lamb &amp;
Harmon, was rising in New York; this was a shaped tower in the local tradition
although devoid of reminiscent stylistic detail. In these same years, however, a well-established
‘traditional’ architect, George Howe (1886-1954),<a id="r489"></a><a href='#f489' class='c025'><sup>[489]</sup></a> in association
with a Swiss, William E. Lescaze (b. 1896), who had been a pupil of
Karl Moser, returned to the Sullivanian slab in designing the
Philadelphia Savings Fund Society Building (Plate #169:pl169). Moreover, they
treated their slab along the lines that the leading European exponents
of the new architecture had adumbrated in the previous ten years. It
would be a score of years before other skyscrapers of such significant
and distinguished design were built in American cities (see Chapter
25).</p>

<p class='c010'>In Sweden E. G. Asplund (1885-1940), whose architecture had hitherto been of a
‘Neo-Neo-Classic’ order, extremely crisp and refined but definitely reminiscent,<a id="r490"></a><a href='#f490' class='c025'><sup>[490]</sup></a>
turned to the new architecture of Le Corbusier and Gropius just before he completed the
Central Library of Stockholm (Plate <a href='#pl176a'>176<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), a building first projected in 1921 but not
opened until 1928 (see Chapter <a href='#ch24'>24</a>). For the Stockholm Exhibition of 1930, of which he
had entire charge, Asplund was soon designing an extensive and elegantly varied range
of pavilions that exploited to the full the possibilities of the new architecture. In Denmark
Kay Fisker (b. 1893) underwent a somewhat less drastic conversion at much the
same time.</p>

<p class='c010'>These years also saw the beginning of the English career of Berthold Lubetkin<a id="r491"></a><a href='#f491' class='c025'><sup>[491]</sup></a>
(b. 1901), a Russian who had settled in England in 1930 after working for some time
in France. His early Gorilla House at the Regent’s Park Zoo in London was soon outshone
by the smaller, but much more remarkable, Penguin Pool there of 1933-5, which
is almost a piece of Constructivist sculpture (Plate <a href='#pl172b'>172<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). In 1933-5 also, the tall block
of middle-class flats, Highpoint I at Highgate outside London, was erected by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>Tecton group, of which Lubetkin was the leading spirit. With its fine hill-top site overlooking
Hampstead Heath, this cruciform tower rivalled Le Corbusier’s Clarté block in
Geneva of 1930-2 in interest and in quality. Almost equally impressive, and like Highpoint
hardly rivalled by comparable work in London since, is the Peter Jones Department
Store in Sloane Square, designed in 1935 by William Crabtree.<a id="r492"></a><a href='#f492' class='c025'><sup>[492]</sup></a> Already in
1933 Mendelsohn had settled in England, practising there for a few years in partnership
with Serge Chermayeff (b. 1900) before moving on to Israel in 1936. From 1934 to 1937
Gropius was in England working with E. Maxwell Fry (b. 1899); Marcel Breuer (b.
1902), a Hungarian pupil of Gropius from the Bauhaus, was also in England working
with F. R. S. Yorke (1906-62). By the mid thirties Connell, Ward &amp; Lucas,<a id="r493"></a><a href='#f493' class='c025'><sup>[493]</sup></a> Wells
Coates (1895-1958), and Frederick Gibberd (b. 1908) were also well started on their
careers.<a id="r494"></a><a href='#f494' class='c025'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In Italy, where the projects of an architect associated with Futurism,<a id="r495"></a><a href='#f495' class='c025'><sup>[495]</sup></a> Antonio
Sant’Elia (1888-1916), before his death in the First World War had offered a remarkable
premonition of the new architecture of the twenties, a fresh talent at least comparable
in interest and individuality to Lubetkin’s appeared on the scene in these years. The
Casa del Fascio at Como of 1932-6 by Giuseppe Terragni (1904-43) is almost as
original as Aalto’s Viipuri Library but very different (Plate <a href='#pl172a'>172<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). In its use of fine
marbles and in its innate classicism it recalls Mies, yet it is as Mediterranean in spirit as
his work is Northern. Unfortunately, like Sant’Elia before him, Terragni was killed
in the Second World War that followed within a few years after the start of his career.
However, the firm of Luigi Figini (b. 1903) and Gino Pollini (b. 1903), who continue to
be leaders of Italian modern architecture, also made their first mark at this time with the
‘Artist’s House’ that they showed at the Fifth Triennale in Milan in 1933. This was
similarly calm and Latin in its handling of the ‘international’ vocabulary of form.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Florence railway station, built in 1934-6 by Giovanni Michelucci (b. 1891) and
five associated architects, also deserves mention. Michelucci is not to be compared
with Terragni or Figini &amp; Pollini, but his station was stylistically the most advanced
in the world when it was built. Moreover, like the Casa del Fascio in Como, it offers
notable evidence of the support the Fascist regime was still giving to <i>architettura razionale</i>
at a time when both in Germany and in Russia other authoritarian regimes were denouncing
the International Style. The Termini Station in Rome (Plate <a href='#pl183b'>183<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) was begun
even earlier from the designs of Angiolo Mazzoni. It owes its distinguished reputation
as the finest station of the twentieth century, however, to the new project of Eugenio
Montuori (b. 1907) and his associates, prepared in 1947 and finally carried to effective
completion in 1951 (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet for all the increasingly wide spread of the new architecture by the mid thirties,
Le Corbusier and two Germans retained their international position of leadership despite
economic depression in France and Hitlerian exile from Germany. If the amount of their
executed work was much reduced—in the case of Mies for several years to nil—the geographical
range of their activities was now much extended. Today, for example, Le Corbusier’s
work is to be found from La Plata in Argentina to Chandigarh in India; he was
also a consultant on two of the largest and most striking buildings in the New World
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>built just before and just after the Second World War, the Ministry of Education and
Public Health in Rio (Plate <a href='#pl171'>171</a>) and the United Nations Secretariat<a id="r496"></a><a href='#f496' class='c025'><sup>[496]</sup></a> in New York.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gropius and Mies, settling in America in the late thirties, became figures of crucial
importance in the reform of American architectural education<a id="r497"></a><a href='#f497' class='c025'><sup>[497]</sup></a> as well as being increasingly
productive as architects since the war. At Harvard University<a id="r498"></a><a href='#f498' class='c025'><sup>[498]</sup></a> and at the
Illinois Institute of Technology, respectively, they set a pace for several American architects
who later became leading educators, such as Howe at Yale and W. W. Wurster
(b. 1895) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California.
Mendelsohn, still very much of an individualist, but with a notable international reputation
based on what he had built in England and in Israel as well as on his earlier work of
the twenties in Germany, practised in America from after the war down to his death.</p>

<p class='c010'>This extension of the field of activity and the direct influence of the European
leaders further emphasized the universal character of the new architecture. Today
American architects, such as the firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill,<a id="r499"></a><a href='#f499' class='c025'><sup>[499]</sup></a> working as far
from home as Turkey, or Edward D. Stone (b. 1902), building on three continents,
provide almost the most characteristic later examples of what—and in their cases most
critics would agree—is not improperly called the International Style. The American
Embassies in Copenhagen and in Stockholm, and the flats for embassy personnel at
Neuilly and at Boulogne outside Paris, all by Rapson<a id="r500"></a><a href='#f500' class='c025'><sup>[500]</sup></a> &amp; Van de Gracht, are perhaps
the most distinguished examples of American work abroad of the 1950s.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there would have been no El Panamá Hotel in Panama (1950) by Stone, no Istanbul
Hilton Hotel (1954) by the Skidmore firm, and no such foreign building programme
by the United States Government as was responsible for the executed embassies by
Rapson &amp; Van de Gracht of the early fifties and the ones since built by Eero Saarinen
in London and Oslo, by Gropius and TAC in Athens, by Stone in New Delhi, and by
Breuer in The Hague but for the pioneering of the Europeans, nor did that pioneering
cease in the thirties. Only in Oud’s case, because of a serious indisposition that removed
him from practice for many years after 1930, was the <i>œuvre</i> effectively complete with
the twenties; and even he is now quite active again. In the case of both Le Corbusier
and Mies, if not of Gropius, their largest commissions came only after the Second
World War. Their influence in the 1950s was still as great as around 1930, in Mies’s
case considerably greater. The mid twentieth century had come to accept stylistic continuity
in a way that the nineteenth century, was never able to do once the tradition
of Romantic Classicism finally wore out. The often adventurous late work of these
men, now become elder statesmen of modern architecture, fortunately counter-balanced
to some extent those more rigid interpretations of the discipline they founded,
interpretations that recurrently threatened after the late twenties to become academic
and frozen in one country or another.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many of the more characteristic demands of Le Corbusier’s aesthetic canon, as it had
been announced in his projects of the early twenties and adumbrated in the succession
of houses that led up to the Savoye house of 1929-30—including restrictions docilely
accepted almost everywhere by advanced architects in the late twenties—were already
ignored in the buildings he himself designed in the early thirties. The house that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>he built for Hélène de Mandrot at Le Pradet in Provence in 193O-1 is raised on no
<i>pilotis</i> but sits firmly on a terrace; and its walls, where solid, are of rough, uncoursed
rubble. Quiet and rectangular, with no lyrically curved elements and little painted
colour, this house accepts the surrounding landscape as Wright’s had always done. Le
Corbusier seemed here almost to be avowing a respect for local materials and humble
village craftsmanship such as is associated with Voysey and his English contemporaries
of a generation earlier that would certainly have been anathema to him in the twenties.
On the other hand, the penthouse that he built in 1931 for Carlos de Beistegui on top
of a block of flats on the Champs Élysées in Paris was all of plate glass and white
marble. This had something of the glittering elegance of Mies’s Barcelona Pavilion of
two years earlier, where the polished marbles, once so brilliantly exploited by Loos, were
first brought back after a decade of restriction to ascetic and impermanent surfaces of
painted stucco.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Salvation Army Building which Le Corbusier erected in 1931-2 in the Rue Cantagrel
in Paris is more in line with the canon of the twenties. Unfortunately the original
curtain-wall is now cut up by projecting sun-breaks added in a post-war refurbishing by
Le Corbusier’s former partner Pierre Jeanneret. The Maison Clarté block of flats of
1930-2 in Geneva is almost as completely glass-walled.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was most notably the Swiss Hostel at the Cité Universitaire in Paris, designed in
1930 and built in 1931-2, which introduced various quite new elements of plan and
design that Le Corbusier would develop much further after the Second World War
(Plate <a href='#pl165b'>165<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The <i>pilotis</i> he used in the twenties were thin and round, rather like Perret’s
columns, though without their facets and capitals; but here a double row of heavy piers
of a complex moulded section carries a dormitory block that is boldly cantilevered
out from them both front and back. The rubble masonry of the Mandrot house was
used here once more for a tall unbroken wall of irregularly curved plan at the rear of the
building; the textured and tonal surface of this wall and its effect of solidity contrasts
both with the exposed concrete of the structural elements and with the smooth areas of
thin stone plaquage on the upper walls. Curves in Le Corbusier’s earlier work were
almost always confined within a bounding rectangle and never made of massive
materials; yet they lost none of their elegance in being handled in this bolder and more
organic way. This is closely related to his later paintings, of which the mural in the
common room here provides a major example.</p>

<p class='c010'>The international depression closed in even more completely on France in the early
thirties than it did elsewhere, and there was no subsequent revival of building activity
such as other countries experienced in the years preceding the Second World War. Le
Corbusier’s activities were therefore more and more confined to projects, most of them
for commissions outside France. However, a small block of flats, very similar to the
Maison Clarté in Geneva, was built at 24 Avenue Nungesser et Coli on the western
edge of Paris in 1933. The most interesting portion of this is the architect’s own penthouse
on top; there, like another Soane, he experimented at small scale with a variety
of vault-topped spaces.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a modest house at 49 Avenue du Chesnay in Vaucresson of 1935 there are no more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>curves in plan than in the Mandrot house, but segmental concrete vaults cover the
rectangular bays of which the plan is made up. Moreover, as if to underline Le Corbusier’s
return towards nature after his earlier devotion to the abstract and the mechanistic,
grass grows over their crowns to provide insulation. The exposed frame of the concrete
structure, where not filled with glass brick, has panels of coursed rubble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Corbusier’s projects of the thirties often included new ideas that others exploited
even before he was able to do so himself in executed work. For example, the Ministry
of Education and Public Health in Rio de Janeiro, on which he was a consultant only,
designed in 1937 and completed in 1942 by Lúcio Costa (b. 1902), Oscar Niemeyer (b.
1907), and a group of others, the great building which opened so brilliantly the story of
the new architecture in Brazil (Plate <a href='#pl171'>171</a>), included on the west front the projecting
sun-breaks he had first proposed in 1933 for certain tall buildings intended to be erected
in Algiers. Such sun-breaks soon became characteristic of mid-century architecture in
all countries where the sun’s heat and glare offered a major problem—in Asia and
Africa as much as in South America. By this device the all-glass wall, favourite large-scale
theme of the new architecture since Mies’s early skyscraper projects, received
a much-needed functional correction. As often before, a real (or supposed) practical
need encouraged the satisfaction of overt or covert aesthetic aspirations; for sun-breaks
very much enhance the three-dimensional interest of large façades, substituting for the
slick planar effects characteristic of the twenties a more articulated sort of surface treatment
related to, but independent of, the expression of skeleton structure. Sun-breaks
even came to be used where they are hardly needed, quite as has been the case with
various other clichés of modern architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the war three major works of Le Corbusier, in the estimation of many critics
his masterpieces, have carried much further the sculptural tendencies of his architecture
of the thirties. One of these, the block of flats called the Unité d’Habitation,<a id="r501"></a><a href='#f501' class='c025'><sup>[501]</sup></a> far out
the Boulevard Michelet in Marseilles, which was first projected in 1946 and finally completed
in 1952, has various other points of interest, however. The Unité realizes on a
large scale Le Corbusier’s ideas for the mass-dwelling, providing a single tall slab large
enough to house a complete community and including, half-way up, a
storey intended to be entirely occupied by shops, as well as other
communal facilities on the roof (Plate #166:pl166). An ingenious section
allows two-storey living-rooms for all the flats and also permits the
use of a skip-stop lift system (Figure <a href='#i386'>51</a>). The framework in front of
the walls provides sun protection for the tall living-room windows and
also shallow balconies for each flat both front and back.</p>

<p class='c010'>Like the Swiss Hostel, the Unité is carried on central supports arranged in a double
row. These are much more massively sculptural than the earlier ones in Paris, and almost
anthropomorphically expressive of weight-bearing. All the poured concrete surfaces are
left rough as they came from the forms, and the prefabricated members of the outer sun-break
system have an exposed pebble aggregate. Everything is bold and masculine, even
coarse, indicating a complete turnabout in Le Corbusier’s understanding of the essential
‘nature’—itself a rather Wrightian concept—of concrete. On the roof an abstract landscape
of sculptural forms plays counterpoint to the superb backdrop of mountains. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>cannot help remembering the roof of Gaudí’s Casa Milá in Barcelona (Plate <a href='#pl137a'>137<span class='fss'>A</span></a>); there
are even some glazed tiles set in the concrete to provide notes of ‘permanent polychrome’.
Yet the window in the entrance-hall at the base of the slab is quite Neoplasticist
in the pattern of its subdivisions and the use of coloured glass; while painted
colour of the boldest sort, by no means restricted to the primaries, is used on the sides of
the sun-breaks, though not on any of the outer surfaces. Thus has Le Corbusier’s later
architecture been enriched by a sort of eclecticism quite remote from his Purist aesthetic
of the twenties.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>At Chandigarh in India, where Le Corbusier had the general responsibility for planning
the entire new capital of the State of Punjab and of building the principal public
monuments, only one or two were by the mid fifties finished; the rest of the city was
the work of other architects, principally Pierre Jeanneret and the English firm of
Maxwell Fry and his wife Jane Drew. The High Courts of Justice,<a id="r502"></a><a href='#f502' class='c025'><sup>[502]</sup></a> built by Le Corbusier
in 1952-6, are even more sculptural than the Unité at Marseilles. A continuous
umbrella-like shell-vault of concrete rises high above the roofs of the court-rooms to
allow the free passage of air. Supporting this are great rounded piers that merge into
the concave surfaces over them, almost like the structural elements of the Casa Milá,
but here of monumental scale. On the west side deep box-crates, with brilliant painted
colours on their soffits like those on the sun-breaks of the Unité, keep the sun off the
glazed walls of the court-rooms and provide that three-dimensional play first exploited
on the Ministry in Rio.</p>

<p class='c010'>The long slab of the Secretariat at Chandigarh, also of 1952-6, with its very varied
pattern of sun-breaks, is less novel than the High Courts; but other work of the mid
fifties at Ahmedabad should not be ignored (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>). However, Le Corbusier’s
most extraordinary late building is in France, not India, and therefore considerably more
accessible. Architects and laymen alike have been consistently impressed by the intense
emotionalism of his church of Notre-Dame-du-Haut at Ronchamp, Hte-Saône,<a id="r503"></a><a href='#f503' class='c025'><sup>[503]</sup></a>
built in 1950-5. Whether this church will ever have as much influence as the Unité has
already had remains debatable because of its very special character. But it certainly
made even more evident than the High Courts the fact that Le Corbusier in the fifties
was moving in almost the opposite direction from that in which he led in the twenties.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>In an exaggerated phrase Le Corbusier described his early houses as <i>machines à
habiter</i>; but Notre-Dame-du-Haut is more like an enormous piece of sculpture than a
‘machine for praying-in’ (Plate <a href='#pl167'>167</a>). He who once drove architecture towards the
mechanistic, the precise, and the volumetric, now provides the exemplar of a new
mode so plastic as almost to be naturalistic in the way of Gaudí’s blocks of flats of fifty
years earlier. The walls and roof are rough, indeed almost brutal, in finish, and so
massive and solid that the interior of the church at certain times of the day seems positively
ill-lit by the tiny deep-sunk windows that irregularly penetrate the side walls. In
place of an aesthetic expression emulating the impersonal results of engineers’ calculations,
there is here a freehand quality comparable to the spontaneity of the sculptor.
Moreover, where the overtones of his characteristic buildings of the twenties were
wholly of the present, this arouses deep prehistoric atavisms—and quite intentionally.
Whether the High Courts at Chandigarh and the church at Ronchamp evidence a deep
split in modern architecture or represent rather a major turning point is still far from
clear. Only a few have yet succeeded in following with any distinction the line of
development they appear to open (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a> and <a href='#epi'>Epilogue</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The later work of the German leaders arouses no such difficult critical problems as
does Le Corbusier’s; yet it has also ranged sometimes in directions not altogether to be
expected from their best-known work of the twenties. Their careers, moreover, suffered
a harsher break because of the political tribulations of their homeland than Le Corbusier
suffered from the economic tribulations of France. In 1930 Mies became Director of
the Bauhaus, remaining until it was closed by Hitler in 1933. Although he won a competition
for the Reichsbank in Berlin as late as that year, he was allowed to do no work
under the Nazis, and so he settled in the United States in 1938 after a preliminary visit the
previous year.</p>

<p class='c010'>As has been noted, Mendelsohn and Gropius, on leaving Germany in 1933, settled
first in England, and both did significant work there—if not especially significant for
their own careers, certainly so for the early stage of modern architecture in England.
With his English partner Maxwell Fry, Gropius was responsible in 1935-7 for the Impington
Village College in Cambridgeshire; this set a new pace for school design in
England in the post-war years, perhaps the best in the world. Mendelsohn, with
Chermayeff, built in 1934-5 the De La Warr Pavilion at Bexhill on the Sussex coast. In
the main this is a rather conventional example of the new architecture; but it has a semicircular
glazed stair-tower that recalls the more lyrical quality of his best earlier work
such as the Schocken department stores.</p>

<p class='c010'>From England Mendelsohn moved on to Israel, where a large Government Hospital
by him at Haifa and the Medical Centre of the Hadassah University in Jerusalem on
Mount Scopus, both of 1936-8, show a most skilful adaptation of the international
European canons to a hotter climate and a different cultural tradition, somewhat as is the
case with the Ministry at Rio. Only with the onset of the war in 1941 did Mendelsohn
settle in America. There his Maimonides Hospital in San Francisco of 1946-50 and
synagogues and Jewish community centres in Cleveland (1946-52), St Louis (1946-50),
Grand Rapids (1948-52), and St Paul (1950-4) continued to illustrate his very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>personal command of the commonly accepted elements of the new architecture, with
the inclusion here and there of anomalous features that seem to belong to a much
earlier period of his career.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gropius proceeded directly from England to America in 1937, having been called by
Dean Joseph Hudnut of the Graduate School of Design to be Professor of Architecture
at Harvard University. He became Chairman of the Architecture Department the following
year, which position he retained until 1953. As has already been said, his major
contribution to architecture in America has been as an educator. However, he built, in
partnership with Breuer, whom he had brought to Harvard, several houses, including
his own at Lincoln, Mass., and also a housing development at New Kensington, Penna.,
in the years 1938-41. These are, on the whole, no more successful than much of his
work of the late twenties in Germany, despite an intelligent effort to adapt a European
mode to American building methods, particularly as regards the use of wood, both
structurally and for sheathing. This turning away, on Gropius’s part, from ferro-concrete
and rendered surfaces is parallel to Le Corbusier’s somewhat earlier reversion
to the use of local and traditional materials. The houses that Breuer designed after he
parted from Gropius have considerably more intrinsic interest; as is perhaps natural in
the work of a younger man, they show a more integral adjustment to the characteristic
living habits and building methods of the New World. Two large-scale commissions,
for the Unesco Building<a id="r504"></a><a href='#f504' class='c025'><sup>[504]</sup></a> in Paris (now nearly finished) and for the Bijenkorf Store in
Rotterdam (1955-7), not to speak of the U.S. Embassy at The Hague, have brought him
back to the European scene, but as an American rather than a Hungarian or German
architect.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gropius’s principal American work was all done after the war. It included by the mid
fifties two schools at Attleborough, Mass., one of 1948 and one of 1954, and the Graduate
Centre of Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., of 1949-50. These were all three
designed—as also the already-mentioned Athens Embassy, which is not yet completed—in
association with the firm known as TAC (The Architects’ Collaborative), consisting
of a group of younger architects, all but one educated at Yale University, formed in
1946. In the double quadrangle of buildings at Harvard, forming in itself almost a
complete small college, the architecture of the twenties lived on with little change.
Light-coloured brick replaced stucco for the walls, however, and there is a certain rather
inhibited use of curves in plan and of angular relationships in detail reflecting ideas that
had entered the new architecture only in the thirties. The Attleborough schools are less
pretentious and altogether more successful, improving upon Gropius and Fry’s Impington
College of the thirties in England in various ways. After his retirement as professor,
Gropius and TAC became increasingly active, and he continued to present his well-known
architectural doctrines in lectures, articles, and books.<a id="r505"></a><a href='#f505' class='c025'><sup>[505]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Coming to the United States a year later than Gropius, Mies also found his greatest
opportunity there, and almost at once. In 1939 he was commissioned to design the entire
new group of buildings for the Illinois Institute of Technology, which was moving to
the south side of Chicago. In this scheme, which is of urbanistic scale and extent, a
classic, indeed an almost academic, order prevails throughout (Figure <a href='#i389'>52</a>). The buildings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>that he was able to execute, two during the war in 1942-4, many more after 1945, have
a comparably classic serenity. But they also express with relentless logic the character of
their predominantly steel-skeleton construction. In them Mies almost revived architectural
detail by the precision and the elaboration of his handling of the elements of
metal structure. As at Gropius’s Graduate Centre, light-coloured brick replaces stucco
for the solid wall panels. The severe patterns of the black-painted metalwork are
organized with something of the purity of Mondrian’s canvases of the twenties yet with
a dominating symmetry. This is true also of the interior planning of the individual
buildings. However, the latest, Crown Hall, housing the architectural school, completed
in 1956, is unsubdivided on the principal floor, and thus represents the most extreme
statement of his later ideals, both structurally and in its planning.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mies also built houses and several tall blocks of flats in and near Chicago and, with Philip
Johnson (b. 1906), a New York skyscraper at 375 Park Avenue for the Seagram Company
in 1956-8 (Plate <a href='#pl192'>192</a>). His completely glazed Farnsworth house near Plano, Ill., designed
in 1946 and built in 1950,<a id="r506"></a><a href='#f506' class='c025'><sup>[506]</sup></a> is a cage of white-painted welded steel raised above
the river valley in which it is set and walled partly with great sheets of plate glass, partly
with metal screening. The floor is a continuous plane of travertine from which broad
travertine steps descend to an open travertine terrace. Planned about a central core in
which are placed the fireplace, the bathrooms, and the heater, the interior space is completely
unified, the different functional areas being separated only by cupboards that do
not rise to the ceiling (Figure <a href='#i390'>53</a>). Even more than Crown Hall, this house represents
the purest and most extreme statement of aesthetic purpose in one particular direction
that the new architecture has yet produced—a direction which is, of course, in total
opposition to the increasingly complex plastic effects sought in these same years by Le
Corbusier. It is, nevertheless, quite as remote from the stucco boxes characteristic of
the twenties and even more remote from Mies’s own brick houses of that period.</p>

<p class='c010'>A similarly ascetic luxury is also evident in Mies’s blocks of flats at 845-860 Lake
Shore Drive in Chicago of 1949-51 (Plate <a href='#pl170'>170</a>). There he seemed to have arrived, not
imitatively but by force of parallel logic, at something very close to the skyscrapers that
Sullivan designed in the nineties (Plate <a href='#pl119'>119</a>). Mies’s structural piers, carried down to the
ground as free-standing elements just as they are below the Farnsworth house, give
the dominant bay rhythm, their structural steelwork being sheathed here first in protective
concrete and then in black-painted metal. Between the piers continuous
<span class="sans">I</span>-shaped
beams along the mullion lines stiffen the
wall screens which are otherwise entirely of glass held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>in bright aluminium frames; they also provide a subsidiary rhythm, quite as Sullivan’s
mullions sometimes did in the eighties and nineties.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Identical in shape, rectangular slabs both, the two blocks were set close together and at
right angles to one another. This placing gave a minimum of overlap as regards the lake
view and a minimum of overlook as regards the privacy of the apartments. The relationship
also creates from these very simple shapes a notable variety of effects in perspective.
The visual interest is enhanced especially by the fact that the projecting
<span class="sans">I</span>-beams,
when seen at a sharp angle, give the illusion that one wall of each block is solid; the other wall,
being seen head on or nearly so, appears completely open between the structural piers
and the mullions. Four more nearly identical apartment blocks<a id="r507"></a><a href='#f507' class='c025'><sup>[507]</sup></a> have risen in Chicago
from Mies’s designs since, the Esplanade Apartments beside the first two towers, and
two farther to the north, not to speak of those in Detroit and Newark.</p>

<p class='c010'>After his arrival in America Mies was not merely for fifteen years the architect of the
Illinois Institute of Technology’s buildings, he soon became head of its Department of
Architecture also, a post he retained until he retired in 1955. Less articulate than Gropius
and occupying a less important academic post, Mies’s influence specifically as an educator
has been considerably less. On the other hand, the general influence of his work in
America in the late forties and fifties has been far greater. The ‘Miesian’ became almost
a sub-school of the new architecture not only in the United States but in several other
countries: to Mies not only younger men but also many established practitioners owed
the specific direction of much of their post-war work (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Just before the Second World War broke out Oud, in 1938, recovered his health
sufficiently to undertake a large commission, the Shell Building in The Hague, completed
in the course of the next four years. In Holland there had been in the thirties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>a strong reaction against the new architecture led by M. J. Granpré-Molière (b. 1883)
and the graduates of his school at Delft. Granpré-Molière urged a return, if not to the
outright ‘traditional’, at least to a semi-traditionalism that was not without some
similarity to what Hitler was sponsoring in Germany. In response to this challenge Oud
set out to show how the new architecture, still considered by many in Holland to be too
stark and mechanistic, could be humanized. To return from stucco to brick, in this
case a thin glazed white brick such as Dudok was using at this same time with great
success on his quite conventionally ‘International Style’ Erasmus Huis office building in
the Coolsingel in Rotterdam,<a id="r508"></a><a href='#f508' class='c025'><sup>[508]</sup></a> was merely to emulate the rejection of stucco in this
decade by the French and German leaders in favour of more permanent, if also more
traditional, walling materials, such as marble, rubble, brick, and even wood. But Oud’s
attempt to revive ornament and the elaborate symmetry and near-academic complications
of his over-all design of the Shell Building had little appeal outside Holland. In
the small Esveha office building of 1952 near the railway station in Rotterdam and the
much larger Vrijzinnige Christelijk Lyceum at 131 Goudsbloemlaan in The Hague of
1953-6 Oud returned to something much closer to the norms of the new architecture
elsewhere. But the day of his great international influence has long been over despite
the belated prestige which is still his in Holland.<a id="r509"></a><a href='#f509' class='c025'><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Like several of the preceding chapters dealing with the architects of the first modern
generation, this has brought some aspects of our story down nearly to the present. In so
doing, the specifically modern architecture of the twentieth century has been largely
accounted for; the picture will be rounded out later by offering a synoptic view of the
international scene at the mid century (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a> and <a href='#epi'>Epilogue</a>). But first it is
necessary to discuss the architecture that was <i>not</i> modern which was produced in the first
four decades of this century. Historicism,<a id="r510"></a><a href='#f510' class='c025'><sup>[510]</sup></a> that is reminiscence of past styles, endemic
throughout the nineteenth century, lived on. It is considered polite to call such architecture
‘traditional’, over-favourably weighted rather than accurate though the term
may be. Clearly a traditional architecture that produced a ‘Gothic’ skyscraper like Cass
Gilbert’s Woolworth Building (Plate <a href='#pl178'>178</a>) or vast ‘Classical’ railway stations like the
two in New York (Plate <a href='#pl177b'>177<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) was not unduly restricted by revivalistic canons. Clearly
also this sort of architecture cannot be ignored historically, since it produced some of
the largest, most prominent, and most carefully studied buildings and groups of buildings
of the first third of this century. Moreover, in many countries traditionalism gave
way to modern design only after the Second World War; while the authoritarian
regimes of Europe in varying degree returned to its sanctions in the thirties, just as it was
generally losing ground elsewhere in the western world.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were few if any great leaders among twentieth-century traditional architects;
certainly hardly more than one or two approached the calibre or the individual significance
of the men whose work Part Three of this book has largely dealt with up to this
point. But a conspectus can be provided, with typical examples of the best work in
several countries, and some indication offered of the character of the production in other
countries where the individual architects were less colourful, the monuments less
notable, and the general level of quality less high.</p>

  <h2 id='ch24' class='c013'><span class='c027'>CHAPTER 24</span><br />ARCHITECTURE CALLED TRADITIONAL<br />IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Through</span> at least the first three decades of the twentieth century most architects of the
western world would have scorned the appellation ‘modern’ or, if they accepted it,
would have defined the term very differently from the way it has been understood in
the immediately preceding chapters. For twentieth-century architecture that continued
the historicism<a id="r511"></a><a href='#f511' class='c025'><sup>[511]</sup></a> of the nineteenth century the usual name in English is ‘traditional’.
This term reflects a fond presumption that such architecture derives its sanctions from
the traditions of the further past, although in fact its only real tradition is that of the preceding
hundred years. Whatever one calls it, this traditional architecture includes the
majority of buildings designed before 1930 in most countries of the western world and a
considerable, if very rapidly decreasing, proportion of those erected since.</p>
<p class='c010'>Statements of this sort are not very relevant when they concern the arts. In the case of
every revolutionary change in architecture the same situation has obtained while the
old slowly gave way to the new. Since the modern revolution may well be of the scale
of the Renaissance, the student of architectural history should recall that from the early
crystallization of the new Italian mode—and at first it was no more than a minor
regional mode—in Florence around 1420 to the general acceptance of a new international
style throughout Europe some two hundred years passed. The Baroque, in
succeeding the Renaissance, came to international dominion only by gradual stages and
eventually died out, not all at once around 1750, but gradually over the next half
century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite prolific production and the quite remarkable things that were occasionally
achieved when historicism came to uneasy terms with new technical means—as had
already happened not infrequently in the nineteenth century—the traditional architecture
of the twentieth century is primarily an instance of survival; and cultural survivals
are among the most difficult problems with which history has to deal. Their sluggish
life, sunk in inertia and conservatism, is very different from the vitality of new
developments. Yet survivals are tough and resilient, tending always to maintain themselves
by their very uneventfulness. Static, not to say smug, assurance is their greatest
strength; their greatest danger is that boredom resulting from excessive familiarity
which they eventually induce.</p>

<p class='c010'>Survivals do not generally rouse the interest of posterity. The Gothic of fifteenth-century
Italy or that of seventeenth-century England has not received from historians
the attention of the rising forces in the architecture of those periods. Somewhat unfairly,
late and anachronistic achievements, if admired at all, are likely to be credited to
the previous age. In America, for example, Grecian plantation houses built as late as the
1850s are frequently called ‘Southern Colonial’. We are too well aware today, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>that the work of the traditional architects of the last fifty or sixty
years is of this century, and not of the previous one, to permit that
kind of confusion. The historian <i>must</i> attempt to give some sort
of account of things like the Stockholm City Hall
(Plate <a href='#pl174a'>174<span class='fss'>A</span></a> and <a href='#pl174b'><span class='fss'>B</span></a>) and the Woolworth Building
(Plate <a href='#pl178'>178</a>). But the story is not an easy one to tell because
it seemed—still at least in the mid twentieth century—to lack plot.
The rise of modern architecture, on the other hand, offers material
for a dramatic narrative, for it follows the pattern of the
‘success-story’, just as does that of the Gothic in twelfth-century
France or the beginnings of the Renaissance in fifteenth-century
Italy.</p>

<p class='c010'>In some areas of the world a meaningful succession of stages can be discerned in the
late period of historicism. Because of the differential lags in various parts of the western
world, however, it is difficult to find a scheme of organization that is at all generally
applicable. All the same, those lags usually mean that certain countries were going
through phases of architectural development in the early twentieth century that more
advanced areas had left behind before 1900. Since those phases have been discussed in
Part Two, it is unnecessary to detail here the peripheral and anachronistic ‘repeats’ of
familiar late nineteenth-century episodes in the present century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without attempting to round out the picture with the citation of multiple examples,
one may at this point suggest some of the aspects, parallel and successive, of twentieth-century
historicism. There was, for example, a characteristic continuation of that reaction
against the boldness and coarseness of the architecture of the third quarter of the
nineteenth century which is recognizable in most countries, and particularly perhaps
in America and England from the eighties; hence the general critical emphasis of the
period on ‘restraint’ and on the ‘tasteful’. Academically designed buildings of the 1920s
were often still intended to realize aspirations that had been novel some forty years
earlier; rarely, however, did they do so with a vitality comparable to that of later nineteenth-century
work. So also Gothic of the early twentieth century produced by such
American architects as Ralph Adams Cram or James Gamble Rogers hardly differs in
its standards from what the English Bodley initiated around 1870.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have already seen in much of the work of Perret and Behrens a special kind of
continuation of the Classical tradition in the twentieth century. This shades down
through various degrees and kinds of simplification as represented in the personal modes
of such architects as Asplund in Sweden or Marcello Piacentini in Italy to the maintenance
of a Classical revivalism as absolute as that of 1800 in white marble temples like
Henry Bacon’s Lincoln Memorial in Washington (Plate <a href='#pl180'>180</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>The medievalizing currents of the nineteenth century link up with many aspects of
the advanced architecture of the early twentieth century. This aftermath, often vital and
creative in the fields of theory and of craftsmanship with architects as different as the
English Voysey and the Spanish Gaudí, likewise shades down through various levels
of decreasing stylization to a literal revivalism that is still in the Victorian tradition, but
more in line with that tradition’s early or Puginian phase or its latest Bodleian phase
than with the Butterfieldian phase of the 1850s and 1860s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both on the Classical and on the Gothic side of the fence, however, there have been
a few twentieth-century traditional architects whose personal stylization of borrowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>forms was almost as extreme as that of the High Victorians. In their work, intense individualism
and limited respect for the canons of ‘taste’ and ‘restraint’ offer real points
of contact with the brashness of such modern architects of the first generation as
Wright and de Klerk. This is in contrast to the other line of traditionalist integrity in
the handling of materials that was solidly based on Gothic Revival standards of revived
hand-craftsmanship, one of the truly positive values contributed to the next generation
by such architects as Richardson in America and Webb in England. The two lines could
also in some milieus combine to produce, particularly in Scandinavia, some of the most
impressive works of the early twentieth century. Such an outline, blurred and overlapping
in its rubrics, can do little more than suggest some of the principal later channels of
the architectural currents which were carried over from the nineteenth century into the
early decades of the twentieth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is still hardly a country in the world where buildings of traditional design
are not being erected; but whatever vitality twentieth-century traditional architecture
retained as late as the second and even the third decade of the century had departed by
the fourth. Post-mortems on traditional architecture have been many—and often premature.
The causes of death are still disputable, but the fact of dissolution is by now
generally accepted. Yet the last years of traditional architecture were not completely
senile. However much the youthful vitality of the newer architecture attracts sympathy
and attention, as late as 1930 its impact on building production was in most countries a
very limited one. It is fortunate, therefore, that not all the traditional architecture of
the years 1900-30 need be dismissed with scorn, even if the standards by which it must
be judged remain those of the nineteenth rather than of the twentieth century.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nineteenth century ended, as we have seen earlier, with a surge of innovation (see
Chapters 14, 15, and 16). Looking forward from the late nineties, a prophet might
well have assumed that a new architecture would surely arise just beyond the turn of the
century; yet within a few years a general reaction set in which took somewhat different
forms in various parts of the western world. As has already been noted, there were
almost everywhere strong links with the earlier Academic Reaction of the eighties against
the bold and brash ‘high styles’ of the mid century; indeed, it may be said that the traditional
architecture of the new century was in general both a continuance and a resurgence
of that reaction. In most European countries, although not in England and
America, the academic architecture of the late nineteenth century had represented little
more than a resurgence or a continuance of certain aspects of decadent Romantic
Classicism. Seeking a loftier pedigree, however, conservative architects often claimed
that they were returning to traditions that had existed down to less than a century before
their own day, quite as various reformers from Pugin to Voysey claimed they were
renewing a link with one or another earlier period.</p>

<p class='c010'>Relatively valid as this might still have been for certain aspects of the Queen Anne
in England and the Colonial Revival in America, or for the parallel return to eighteenth-century
modes in various Continental countries towards the end of the century, this
theory had already run into serious difficulties long before 1900. A church might hope
to be plausibly Gothic, but a railway station could only be Victorian Gothic; a skyscraper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>could not even be as Gothic as that. Moreover, the tide of eclecticism that
had been rising since the mid eighteenth century was not turned back; for both the
reaction of the 1880s and the later reaction of the early 1900s represented chiefly a
rejection of earlier nineteenth-century innovations, especially of novel sorts of detail,
rather than positive programmes of exclusive revival.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is possible, at least for individual countries, to make statements concerning what
occurred in the field of traditional design between the 1890s and the 1930s that are not
wholly without significance. Of Holland it may be said, negatively, that no reaction of
consequence towards the traditional occurred before the mid thirties. In Germany the
boundary line between what was traditional and what was modern was always fairly
vague; yet evidence of a return to stylistic reminiscence after the earliest years of the
century is to be found even in the work of leaders of the first generation of modern
architects such as Olbrich and Behrens (see Chapter <a href='#ch20'>20</a>). Farther to the North in Denmark
and Sweden, the Copenhagen Town Hall of 1892-1902 (Plate <a href='#pl173a'>173<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) by Martin
Nyrop (1849-1923) and the contemporary post offices and fire stations in Stockholm and
Malmö by Ferdinand Boberg (1860-1940) resemble Berlage’s Exchange in Amsterdam
in their haunting parallelism to the Richardsonian of the eighties in America and even,
to some extent, to the Shavian of the seventies in England. It is true that Absalons Gaard,
built in 1901-2 by Vilhelm Fischer (1868-1914) in the square in front of Nyrop’s Town
Hall, and even more notably the nearby Palace Hotel of 1907-10 by Anton Rosen
(1859-1928), developed the freer implications of Nyrop’s manner with an almost Dutch
verve. But more characteristically there followed in Scandinavia from about 1900, as
elsewhere rather earlier, a programme of tasteful emulation of local versions of the
Baroque and then, from shortly after 1910 in Denmark and a decade later in Sweden, an
even more programmatic revival of Romantic Classicism.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Scandinavian development from 1890 to 1930 there is therefore a sort of ‘plot’
or recognizable sequence of phases despite their overlappings. What has been called
‘National Romanticism’, rooted in the cultural climate of the eighties, had a briefer span
in Denmark than in Sweden. Nyrop’s Town Hall, begun in 1892, although
in fact hardly more traditional than Berlage’s Amsterdam Exchange,
introduced the mode, and the Stockholm Town Hall (Plate <a href='#pl174a'>174<span class='fss'>A</span></a>
and <a href='#pl174b'><span class='fss'>B</span></a>) by Ragnar Östberg
(1866-1945), completed thirty years later, brought it to a close. But
its dominion in Denmark was never exclusive. Although the Custom House
of 1897 at Aarhus by Hack Kampmann (1856-1920) with its picturesque
high roofs and corner towers belongs to the mode, his Aarhus Theatre
of 1898-1900 and his City Library there of 1898-1902 do not.
Externally, the theatre is in the main of Early Renaissance design,
although with considerable eclecticism in the detail; on the other
hand, the library is even less traditional than Nyrop’s Town Hall.
Both, moreover, have extremely rich plaster decoration inside that may
not improperly be called Art Nouveau.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wahlman’s Engelbrekt Church of 1904-14 in Stockholm, mentioned
earlier as an exception to the general dominance of tradition in
Scandinavia in these decades, and the Grundvig Church in Copenhagen
(Plate <a href='#pl175b'>175<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) by P. W. Jensen Klint (1853-1930),
originally designed in 1913 and completed finally in 1926, are both
closely related to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>earlier National Romanticism of the eighties and nineties. By the time the latter was
designed, however, this phase had for some years been superseded by a sort of Neo-Baroque
still also very nationalistic in its choice of precedents and very romantic in their
handling. Sometimes, however, this mode approached eighteenth-century revivalism
of the sort that flourished in England and America. For example, the Marselisberg
Slot, built by Kampmann for the Danish Crown Prince at Aarhus in 1899-1902, is the
precise Danish equivalent of the best Neo-Georgian houses of the period in England
and America.</p>

<p class='c010'>Monuments such as the Masthugg Church (Plate <a href='#pl175a'>175<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) of 1910-14
in Göteborg by Sigfrid Ericson (b. 1874) or the Högalid Church of
1916-23 in Stockholm by Ivar Tengbom (b. 1878) are hardly recognizable
as Neo-Baroque to non-Swedish eyes, for they are composed with a sense
of visual drama quite equal to Wahlman’s and very stylized in all
their detailing. Ericson’s, in particular, has much in common with the
American Shingle Style, although that was rarely used for churches and
never for big ones of stone or brick construction.</p>

<p class='c010'>In much secular Swedish work in the Neo-Baroque mode, such as the very typical
ASEA Building of 1916-19 in Västeros by Erik Hahr (1869-1944), bold asymmetrical
massing and onion-domed towers reflect the romanticism of the churches and also recall
early stages of the revived Queen Anne in England in the seventies. Danish taste in the
second decade of the century was much more severe than Swedish, as in fact it had
always been, and the characteristic low-cost housing blocks in Copenhagen of this
period, such as those of 1914 in the Amagertorv by Hansen &amp; Hygom, are, so to say,
only Neo-Baroque round the edges.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the 1920s, however, the most significant phase was the third, that is the return to
Romantic Classicism. This was initiated in Denmark by Carl Petersen (1874-1923) in his
Faaborg Museum designed in 1912, and reached its climax immediately after the First
World War. In Sweden the parallel phase began a bit later. By the time such men as
Fisker in Denmark, Asplund in Sweden, and Aalto in Finland became ‘converts’ to the
International Style in the late twenties, Scandinavian traditionalism had become almost
as purged of stylistic detail as the architecture of Tony Garnier, or even that of Adolf
Loos, had been for a generation.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the whole the Danes and the Swedes produced the most lively and distinguished
traditional architecture of the early decades of the century. Medievalizing churches in
Scandinavia, such as the just-mentioned Grundvig Church in Copenhagen, where
Jensen Klint followed Baltic modes that seemed strange and even Expressionist to foreign
eyes, or Tengbom’s Högalid Church in Stockholm, superbly sited and actually much
more Baroque than Gothic in its detail, make the respectable Neo-Perpendicular and
Neo-Georgian exercises of contemporary Anglo-Saxon architects look timid and unimaginative.
In both cases it is the stylization of proportion—the tremendous verticality—that
makes them striking and full of a sort of vitality, at once nervous and lusty, which
is comparable to that of the best High Victorian Gothic churches.</p>

<p class='c010'>The finest medievalizing work is undoubtedly Östberg’s Stockholm Town Hall of
1909-23.<a id="r512"></a><a href='#f512' class='c025'><sup>[512]</sup></a> This is an exceedingly eclectic combination of elements adapted from various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>periods both of the Swedish and the general European past. Superbly
set at the water’s edge, it is sumptuously decorated inside and out
with products of craftsmanship that are of a very high order of
competence (Plate <a href='#pl174a'>174<span class='fss'>A</span></a> and <a href='#pl174b'><span class='fss'>B</span></a>).
Despite his eclecticism, Östberg succeeded in imposing on all his
disparate elements a high degree of personal stylization at the same
time that he exploited the situation with marvellous dramatic effect.
There is also a witty allusiveness suggesting the art of the theatre
and the exotic fantasies of the late eighteenth century. The Stockholm
Town Hall provides a sort of pageant-setting for the ceremonial life
of the city, recalling the splendours of town-hall architecture of
many epochs of the past, even though it lacks the straightforwardness
and the integrity of Nyrop’s earlier Town Hall in Copenhagen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The outside world had hardly had time to apprehend such new Scandinavian building
in the years following the First World War before it became evident that architecture
in these countries, hitherto on the whole in stylistic retard of developments elsewhere
by almost a generation, had taken a surprisingly sharp turn. Petersen’s museum at
Faaborg followed the local Romantic Classical models of C. F. Hansen far more
literally than any of the contemporary admirers of Schinkel in Germany were doing.
Brought to completion in 1916 during the First World War, it attracted very little
foreign attention at the time it was built. But the Police Headquarters in Copenhagen
by Kampmann, erected after the war in 1918-22, with its great colonnaded circular
court, and the Øregaard School (Plate <a href='#pl176b'>176<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) at 32 Gersonsvej in the Gentofte Kommune
north of Copenhagen by Edward Thomsen (b. 1884) and G. B. Hagen (1873-1941)
that followed in 1922-4 were at once noticed abroad. Both indeed are notable
for their grandeur and for their simplicity, the latter realizing old Romantic Classical
ideals with extraordinary success, the former coming closer to the academic work of
McKim, Mead &amp; White in America.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still simpler, and not without a similar sort of understated grandeur surprising in such
work, were the Danish low-cost housing blocks erected in the early twenties in succession
to those of Hansen &amp; Hygom. Those by Povl Baumann (b. 1878) in the Hans
Tavsengade or the enormous Hornsbaekhus of 1923 by Kay Fisker (b. 1893), all in
Copenhagen, are especially fine. The extreme precision, the elegant craftsmanship in
brick, and the ascetic detailing of these blocks of flats, rivalling the contemporary ones
by de Klerk and by Kramer in Amsterdam in quality but subscribing to a quite opposed
aesthetic, are found also in many Danish private houses of the twenties built by Gotfred
Tvede (1863-1947) and other architects both in the city and in the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although Carl Westmann (1866-1936) in the Röhss Museum of Handicraft at Göteborg
and Erik Lallerstedt (1864-1955) in the University of Architecture and Engineering
at Stockholm approached the simplicity and fine craftsmanship in brick of the Danes,
Swedish work of this period was in general richer and more robust, still reflecting the
very eclectic sources of inspiration of Östberg’s Town Hall. However, in 1923 Neo-Classicism
of a more attenuated and whimsical order than Petersen’s made a striking
appearance in the buildings for the Göteborg Jubilee Exhibition. Of these the Congress
Hall by Arvid Bjerke (b. 1880), with its serried clerestories carried on arched principals,
was the boldest and least reminiscent. These Göteborg pavilions were very influential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>abroad in the mid and late twenties; detailing of Swedish inspiration then seemed to
offer to traditional designers elsewhere a sort of Nordic spice with which to enliven the
dead-level of the local eighteenth-century revivals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tengbom, deserting the romantic eclecticism and the emotional drama of his earlier
Högalid Church, used a highly stylized, almost exposition-like, Neo-Classic mode for
his Stockholm Concert Hall of 1920-6. However, the climax in Sweden—if not, indeed,
the climax as regards all Scandinavia—came with Asplund’s Central Library in Stockholm,
begun in 1921 and much simplified and refined as construction proceeded through
the mid twenties. Rejecting the frivolous decorative detail of his Skandia Cinema of
1922-3, Asplund rivalled the Danes in reducing architecture to geometrical simplicity
(Plate <a href='#pl176a'>176<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). Thus he might almost seem to have passed beyond C. F. Hansen and
Schinkel, the Scandinavian idols of the day, to draw the inspiration for his plain cylinder
rising out of a cube directly from Ledoux or Boullée (Plate <a href='#pl002a'>2<span class='fss'>A</span></a>); while at the base he
ran a continuous band of windows derived from the newest architecture of these years in
France, Germany, and Holland. This juxtaposition in the same edifice of Ledoux and
Le Corbusier, so to put it, is rather awkward; but it is highly symptomatic of the very
slight step that the Scandinavians had still to take in the late twenties when they gave
up revived Romantic Classicism—already pared down to basic geometry in this library
and in much Danish housing—to become outright converts to the International Style.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although Sweden and Denmark produced no modern architect of the first generation
of such individual distinction as the Finnish Saarinen, and must in any case be considered
to have started out around 1900 from a position somewhat in retard of the
French and the Germans, their early twentieth-century architecture largely avoided the
stasis of traditionalism elsewhere, moving through overlapping but discrete phases to an
early and sympathetic acceptance of the new international architecture of the twenties
even before that decade was over. So clear a picture is hard to discern in most other
countries.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the United States the pattern of development between the 1890s and the 1930s, in
so far as one can make out any pattern at all, was quite different; nor was there in America,
in the way of England in the twenties, any Swedish influence of consequence. Movements
roughly equivalent to the Scandinavian National Romanticism of 1900, the
Richardsonian Romanesque and the Shingle Style, had flourished in the eighties and
come to an end by 1900. The Academic Reaction that early succeeded them swept on,
however, for some forty years. Despite the ruling eclecticism of taste that permitted an
archaeological sort of revived Gothic still to thrive as a mode for churches and educational
institutions, the more widely favoured Classical, Renaissance, and Georgian
stylisms had all been initiated by McKim, Mead &amp; White in the eighties and early
nineties. The quality of their work began to decline<a id="r513"></a><a href='#f513' class='c025'><sup>[513]</sup></a> almost as soon as their professional
primacy became assured; yet their best buildings of the first decade of the new century
undoubtedly remain among the most competent, if unexciting, examples of traditional
architecture then produced anywhere. Americans, not Frenchmen, were in these decades
the worthiest products of the École des Beaux-Arts, and thus heirs of the strongest
academic tradition in the world.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>Whether McKim, Mead &amp; White’s models be Renaissance, as in the University Club
in New York (Plate <a href='#pl179'>179</a>) completed in 1900, the series of Branch Public Libraries there
that were built over the next dozen years, and the Tiffany Building finished in 1906; or
Classical, as in the Knickerbocker Trust in New York and the Bank of Montreal in
Montreal, both completed in 1904, the very similar Girard Trust in Philadelphia of
1908, and the vast Pennsylvania Station in New York of 1906-10, this New York firm
was clearly one of the truest successors to the nineteenth-century academic heritage that
so many of the French were frittering away at the opening of the new century in a half-hearted
flirtation with the Art Nouveau.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Gare d’Orsay in Paris of 1898-1900 (Plate <a href='#pl183a'>183<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) by V.-A.-F. Laloux (1856-1937)
is no more to be compared with the Americans’ station than his Hôtel de Ville at
Tours of 1904-5 with their clubs and banks—his best work, closer to the tradition of
Duquesney and Hittorff, was an earlier station, that at Tours of 1895-8. Yet Laloux was
often considered the most accomplished French traditional architect of the period.<a id="r514"></a><a href='#f514' class='c025'><sup>[514]</sup></a> Moreover,
the McKim, Mead &amp; White repertory of stylistic modes was wide: much wider
than that of the French, although Laloux did produce in Saint-Martin at Tours, completed
in 1904, a domed basilica still in the line of the earlier French Romanesquoid
churches, though not at all of the quality of Vaudremer’s Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge
of the sixties.</p>

<p class='c010'>McKim, Mead &amp; White exploited a vernacular Colonial Revival, as in the E. D.
Morgan house of 1900 at Wheatley Hills, Long Island, as well as a more formal Neo-Georgian,
at which several others, such as Delano &amp; Aldrich<a id="r515"></a><a href='#f515' class='c025'><sup>[515]</sup></a> and Charles A. Platt (1861-1933),
were quite as competent as they. But they could also shade their Classicism towards
the Byzantine, as in the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York completed
in 1906, or adapt it to industrial uses, as in the I.R.T. Power Station in New York of
1903. They could even extend it upward into skyscrapers, as in the New York Municipal
Building completed in 1908, concentrating all their attention on the ground floor and
the crowning feature while ignoring the many-storeyed shank between; or spread it
thin over large apartment houses such as that they built in 1918 at 998 Fifth Avenue,
one of the best examples of the apparently solid blocks that walled one side of that
thoroughfare above 57th Street facing Central Park and soon turned Park Avenue from
46th to 96th Street into a man-made canyon. The one thing they and their contemporaries
seemed to be unable to do was to make their architecture live, even with the
derivative vitality of the Scandinavians. Frozen ideals of stylistic ‘correctness’ stifled
such expression of individual personality as gives real character to the work of a
Tengbom or a Kampmann even when it comes closest to theirs.</p>

<p class='c010'>In popular estimation certain buildings that made use of Gothic rather than Classical,
Renaissance, or Georgian forms had a higher reputation. Cass Gilbert’s already-mentioned
Woolworth Building finished in 1913 (Plate <a href='#pl178'>178</a>) initiated a considerable range
of Gothic skyscrapers, including Howells &amp; Hood’s Chicago Tribune Tower of 1923-5,
but it remains in the judgement of posterity the most notable example of this sort of
applied medieval design. Despite the considerable acclaim it received when new, such
an equally characteristic Romanesquoid example as the Shelton Hotel of 1929 by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Arthur Loomis Harmon (b. 1901) rivals Gilbert’s no more in interest than in height.
The New York Telephone Company Building, completed in 1926 by Ralph Walker
(b. 1889) at the beginning of his career with the firm of McKenzie, Voorhees &amp; Gmelin,
is more original. Its fortress-like masses, somewhat frivolously relieved by ornamental
touches borrowed from the Paris Exposition of 1925, and its isolated location at the
Hudson River’s edge, ensure that its bold silhouette will long vie, for the visitor arriving
from abroad, with the so much taller and richer silhouette of the Woolworth Building.
Most of the other individual big buildings of the twenties in New York and other large
American cities are no more than incidental elements in the man-made mountain ranges
of their skylines.</p>

<p class='c010'>Curiously enough the ‘correct’ Gothic churches of this period do not receive today
as favourable a response as the large-scale medievalizing secular work that is necessarily
so very unlike real work of the Middle Ages. Those of Ralph Adams Cram (1863-1942),
then the most esteemed Gothic practitioner, are lifeless and even crude beside Bodley’s
and Pearson’s in England from which they largely derive. His first church, All Saints’,
Ashmont, outside Boston which was built in 1892 is by its early date the least anachronistic.
Cram’s former partner Goodhue’s St. Vincent Ferrer in New York completed
in 1916, a competent and well-scaled example of Late Gothic that is more Continental
than English in character, is rather more successful than any of their joint work
or that which Cram did later with his other partner Ferguson. Bertram Grosvenor
Goodhue (1869-1924), responsible also, as has been noted, for the Spanish Colonial
revival in California, moved on in the early twenties just before his death to an eclectic
sort of semi-modernism best represented by his Nebraska State Capitol in Lincoln. This
is vaguely Byzantinesque, yet towered instead of being domed in what had been the
tradition for state capitals ever since Bulfinch’s in Boston. His contemporary Los Angeles
Public Library is starker and more like a project by Tony Garnier.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were other architects to match McKim, Mead &amp; White directly at their own
academic exercises: most notably John Russell Pope (1874-1937), with his Temple of
Scottish Rite in Washington completed in 1916, a grandiose reconstruction of the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus; and Henry Bacon (1866-1924), with his Lincoln Memorial
completed the following year (Plate <a href='#pl180'>180</a>). The latter is a peripteral Greek Doric temple
of white marble with a high attic that might almost have been designed in Paris in the
1780s—no mean compliment. Equally French in spirit, but with no such evident prototypes,
is the Grand Central Station in New York, built in 1903-13 by Reed &amp; Stem and
Warren &amp; Wetmore.<a id="r516"></a><a href='#f516' class='c025'><sup>[516]</sup></a> More efficiently organized than the Pennsylvania Station, its
concourse is one of the grandest spaces the early twentieth century ever enclosed
(Plate <a href='#pl177b'>177<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Compared to most work of these decades by French architects, all trained like the
American leaders at the École des Beaux-Arts, the greater ‘correctness’ of the detailing
of these buildings is notable. The boast of ‘good taste’ was not altogether a hollow one,
although it is at best a negative rather than a positive criterion for architecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>So extensive was American building production during the twenties that it is difficult
to know how to epitomize it.<a id="r517"></a><a href='#f517' class='c025'><sup>[517]</sup></a> On the one hand, there are the later skyscrapers, essaying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>new stylistic garments as the older ones lost their piquancy. Even before the Romanesquoid
of Harmon’s Shelton Hotel had come the massive simplicity of Walker’s
Telephone Building. But for all the playing around with superficially novel decoration
borrowed from the Paris Exposition of 1925 in the succeeding years, there was no
basic renewal of form before next decade opened. Just after the crash of 1929
terminated the boom, the second skyscraper age came to a belated close with the erection
in the early thirties of Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon’s Empire State Building and the
initiation of the Rockefeller Center project.<a id="r518"></a><a href='#f518' class='c025'><sup>[518]</sup></a> There a more urbanistic grouping, extending
over a considerable area, replaced the earlier ideal of building single structures
of ever greater height that had just reached its climax with the Empire State
Building. This change in approach, recognized ever since as a turning point, was for a
long time hardly at all followed up. However, the spaced skyscrapers of Pittsburgh’s
rebuilt Golden Triangle and, since then, various projects of urban renewal for big and
middle-sized cities from coast to coast are shifting the emphasis from individual structures
to the wholesale reorganization of very large areas (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a> and <a href='#epi'>Epilogue</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>In the terms of this chapter neither the Empire State Building nor Rockefeller Center
are examples of traditional architecture, even if it is hardly proper to consider them
‘modern’ in the sense of the European architecture of their day. Although likewise no
example of the new architecture as then understood in Europe like Howe &amp; Lescaze’s
Philadelphia Savings Fund Society Building of 1932 (Plate <a href='#pl169'>169</a>), such a clean-cut skyscraper
as Hood’s vertically striped Daily News Building in New York marked with
more distinction than its outsize rivals the end of traditional design in this field.</p>

<p class='c010'>Almost as remarkable as the skyscrapers of the twenties in size and elaboration were
the groups of new buildings in which so many academic institutions, both new and old,
variously housed themselves. The mode is Classical at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, built by Welles Bosworth (b. 1869) in 1912-15 on the Charles River in
Cambridge, Mass.; ‘Georgian-Colonial’ in the range of ‘Houses’ that Coolidge, Shepley,
Bulfinch &amp; Abbott<a id="r519"></a><a href='#f519' class='c025'><sup>[519]</sup></a> built in the twenties for Harvard, also along the Charles River in
Cambridge; it is Gothic at Cram &amp; Ferguson’s Graduate College at Princeton, N.J.
(Plate <a href='#pl177a'>177<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) completed in 1913, in the Harkness Quadrangle, designed in 1917, and
other later buildings for Yale at New Haven, Conn., by James Gamble Rogers (1867-1947),
and at the Men’s Campus by Horace Trumbauer (1869-1938) at Duke University
in Durham, North Carolina; it is even, by exception, Byzantinoid at Cram’s
Rice Institute at Houston, Texas, opened in 1912. The usual modes for such work were
what was known as ‘Collegiate’ Gothic, based rather loosely on work at Oxford and
Cambridge that was quite as likely to be nineteenth-century as medieval in date, and
Neo-Georgian in an Anglo-American version, usually too grand to be plausibly Colonial
yet too casually composed to be properly Anglo-Palladian. Curiously enough, the Gothic
Cram’s Neo-Georgian Sweet Briar College in Virginia of 1901-6 is more successful than
much of his own medievalizing work or than comparable work by those who specialized
in eighteenth-century design.</p>

<p class='c010'>The technical competence of American architects in this period was very great, the
sums of money available almost unlimited, and the avowed standards of design only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>the vague ones of ‘taste’ and ‘correctness’, by this time little more than a schoolmasterish
respect for precedent in detail, though rarely in over-all composition.<a id="r520"></a><a href='#f520' class='c025'><sup>[520]</sup></a> Far less
than in Scandinavia is it possible to define the particular ways in which the period expressed
itself, for express itself America in these decades undoubtedly did. Yet, when
Americans of this period worked abroad, what they produced is readily distinguishable
from the work of local traditionalists. The American Academy on the Gianicolo
in Rome, built by McKim, Mead &amp; White in 1913, has a certain chaste precision in
its High Renaissance detailing no Italian could then have achieved even if he had
wanted to. In London Helmle &amp; Corbett’s<a id="r521"></a><a href='#f521' class='c025'><sup>[521]</sup></a> Bush House, rising between the Strand
and Aldwych, has a clarity of form and a sense of urbanistic responsibility that few
comparable buildings of its period designed by leading British architects display; up
to a point, the same is true of Carrère &amp; Hastings’s<a id="r522"></a><a href='#f522' class='c025'><sup>[522]</sup></a> Devonshire House in Piccadilly of
1924-6. The Ritz Hotel of 1906 across the street by the Anglo-French firm of Mewès &amp;
Davis,<a id="r523"></a><a href='#f523' class='c025'><sup>[523]</sup></a> both of them trained at the École des Beaux-Arts as was Thomas Hastings, is
bolder in scale, less priggish, but it also lacks the suavity and finish of its neighbour.
Bolder also, indeed too monumental for its size, is Barclays Bank of 1926 by W. Curtis
Green (b. 1875), near by in Piccadilly across Arlington Street. Of more nearly comparable
quality is Green’s earlier Westminster Bank of 1922-3 on the north side of
Piccadilly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhere between the extreme professional competence of the traditional architects
of America, a competence almost wholly anonymous in its results, and the intensely
personal expression of the Scandinavians lies the pattern that the best traditional architecture,
such as Green’s, followed in England in the early twentieth century. But before
turning to that a good deal more should first be said concerning both the competence
and the anonymity of American production, since that competence and even that anonymity
came to be accepted throughout the western world as desirable<a id="r524"></a><a href='#f524' class='c025'><sup>[524]</sup></a> characteristics of
modern architecture by a great many architects, at least in the mid century.</p>

<p class='c010'>Partnerships were not unknown in the nineteenth century, although professional
alliances between strong personalities rarely lasted for long. When the partner was not
an equal the historian is often justified in writing, say, of G. G. Scott and forgetting
Moffatt or, with rather less justification, only of Sullivan while ignoring Adler. But
architectural firms that include three or more named partners, with still other members
listed only on the letter-head; others such as D. H. Burnham <i>and Company</i> and Albert
Kahn <i>Incorporated</i>, or ‘partnerships’, such as McKim, Mead &amp; White or Cram &amp; Ferguson,
which continued to function under the same name for decades after the death of the
original partners like so many firms of lawyers: these are more or less peculiar to the
twentieth century and first became common in the United States. Today, moreover, an
architect of European background like Mies van der Rohe does not undertake large-scale
operations in America, such as the group of buildings for the Illinois Institute of
Technology or <i>a fortiori</i> his tall blocks of flats in Chicago and the Seagram skyscraper in
New York, without associating himself with such large local firms. Wright and Gropius
solved the problem somewhat differently; but the Taliesin Fellowship and TAC provided
them respectively with the relatively modest and idiosyncratic equivalents of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>organization of the big Harrison &amp; Abramowitz firm in New York or of one of the
Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill offices in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and
Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The development of the characteristic large-scale American architectural office seems
to have begun in Chicago. Burnham, on the death of his designing partner Root in 1891,
just after they had undertaken the primary responsibility for the general planning and
building of the World’s Fair of 1893, had to set up an organization of which he was no
more than the executive head. But the office of McKim, his closest associate in carrying
out the Fair, was certainly already far advanced along a parallel road. There is a
definite connexion here also with the rise of the skyscraper, for those very large commercial
buildings already required a vast amount of uninspired draughting that could
be efficiently undertaken only by a large force of assistants working in what came
later to be derisively called ‘plan-factories’.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same is even more true of industrial work. Here Albert Kahn took the lead
around 1905 in developing a type of subdivision and flow of work in his office in Detroit
comparable to the new methods of mass-production that his motor-car factories were
specifically designed to facilitate. Such patterns are found at their extreme in the group<a id="r525"></a><a href='#f525' class='c025'><sup>[525]</sup></a>
of firms that together produced Rockefeller Center, in the Harrison &amp; Abramowitz
office which is in effect their heir, and in the largely post-war expansion of Skidmore,
Owings &amp; Merrill. Abroad, more characteristically, such organizations have been built
up in offices under a public authority such as those of the London and the Hertfordshire
County Councils, the City Architects’ Offices in various German cities, or the Banco
Obrero housing agency in Venezuela.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Plan-factories’ are undoubtedly conducive to speed and to a certain sort of competence
in the execution of large projects, but it must be evident that the architecture
they produce will necessarily be anonymous. In defining the character of their competence,
moreover, one must be careful not to imply too much. Only such team-work,
perhaps, can organize the logistics of building production in such a way that extensive
and ramified ventures are carried rapidly to completion, a desideratum of the first order
in a boom period for skyscrapers that must be finished quickly in order to begin repaying
their enormous cost. Efficiency is of a different sort of consequence where large-scale
building schemes of a more public and social nature are being undertaken, but none
the less extremely important. Le Corbusier’s Unité at Marseilles, produced without an
elaborate office organization, took some six years to build; as a result it was no longer
‘low-cost housing’ when it was finally completed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet competence in the sections of a big office that deal with the plumbing, say, or the
electrical system is no assurance that the quite different sort of competence required in
the design department will be available. Moreover, a brilliant initial design may or may
not survive intact the various modifications that other departments bring to it as the
preparatory paper-work for the building moves through successive stages to ultimate
execution. At best, even when a particular designer’s name is associated with a particular
building, as is that of Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill with Lever
House (Plate <a href='#pl189'>189</a>), his responsibility is of a very different order from Wright’s for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>Price Tower-although not perhaps so different from Mies’s for the Seagram skyscraper.</p>

<p class='c010'>The situation in England in the first third of the century was rather different from that
in America despite a nineteenth-century inheritance which was in many aspects common
to both countries. One architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, had a personal capacity for
invention along traditional lines superior to that of any American of his generation.
This was not, however, of the order of individualistic intensity of an Östberg or a Jensen
Klint, nor was he able, in the way of an Asplund or even a Hood, to accept around 1930
the discipline of the newer architecture of the day. Lutyens built no skyscrapers, nor did
he develop the sort of office organization that made them possible in America. This was,
however, occurring to some extent by the twenties and thirties in other big English
offices, such as those of Sir John Burnet &amp; Tait<a id="r526"></a><a href='#f526' class='c025'><sup>[526]</sup></a> and of Curtis Green.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the same, it fell to Lutyens’s lot to build some of the biggest business structures
erected anywhere outside America in these years, and his career culminated in the design
and construction of an imperial capital such as came the way of no American. His competence
was of a more nineteenth-century order than that of the Americans, and there
was certainly nothing anonymous about his work. He was, moreover, still an inspiriting
figure in an England where architecture, under the difficult economic conditions since
the last war, tended to become anonymous without becoming especially competent,
except for public housing and for schools (see Chapter <a href='#ch25'>25</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Lutyens’s beginnings were very remote from the world of business and governmental
buildings with which his career wound up (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>). Very early houses, such as
Ruckmans of 1894 at Oakwood Park or Sullingstead of 1896 at Hascombe, both in
Surrey, followed directly in the line of Shaw’s Surrey manor-houses with their tile-hung
walls, free and easy composition, and simple domesticity of tone. They are, indeed,
superior to most of Shaw’s—the first of which, Glen Andred, was built almost
thirty years earlier and the last about this time—because of Lutyens’s respect for Webb
and the resultant superiority of his craftsmanship. In his finest early houses, such as
Deanery Gardens at Sonning of 1901 (Plate <a href='#pl182b'>182<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), he rivalled Voysey. He was already
inclined, however, like Webb in many of his later houses, to use considerable stylistic
detail, usually Neo-Georgian, in his interiors, and here and there on exteriors as well.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps the revolution—or counter-revolution—in his development represented by
his Heathcote of 1906 at Ilkley in Yorkshire has been somewhat exaggerated. Yet the
design of this, completely symmetrical and quite elaborately Palladian in detail, did
represent as great a shift in approach, taken in one jump, as that from Shaw’s Glen
Andred of the late sixties to his Chesters of the early nineties. It was, however, practically
the same shift. Eclectic like almost all the traditional architects of his generation, Lutyens
still occasionally remodelled medieval houses, but the main line of his development
henceforth was certainly Neo-Georgian. Yet it was usually Neo-Georgian with an important
difference from what had become by this time in England as in America a
rather drearily codified mode. Nashdom at Taplow in Buckinghamshire, built in 1909,
is a vast white-painted house, plain, regular, massive, and hardly at all archaeological.
Yet this is so handsomely proportioned and so well built that one could well believe
it to be the result of some generations-long process of accretion in the eighteenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>century. Great Maytham in Kent of 1910 is Queen Anne, but not the Queen Anne of
the 1870s. Here a great mansion of the early eighteenth century was re-created with
such a plausibility of craftsmanship that after only half a century it was hard to believe
it was not two hundred and fifty years old. A somewhat smaller house, the Salutation
at Sandwich of 1912, is similar and perhaps even more remarkable as an example of what
is almost ‘productive archaeology’ on the part of a man who was not, in fact, at all
archaeologically minded. Such houses are the twentieth-century equivalents of Devey’s
in the nineteenth century, but they often have a witty originality in the handling of
traditional detail that has aptly been called ‘naughty’ and is peculiarly personal to
Lutyens.<a id="r527"></a><a href='#f527' class='c025'><sup>[527]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>If the Georgian had to be revived in the way of the Greek and the Gothic, it could
hardly have been done with more competence and more animation; certainly the
Americans of Lutyens’s generation rarely excelled so notably in this particular field,
although many of the once highly esteemed firms mentioned earlier positively specialized
in it. Beside these houses of Lutyens, the Neo-Georgian of the Shepley firm’s
Harvard Houses or Cram’s Sweet Briar College is merely routine. Yet in such work
Lutyens was still only a country-house architect.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before discussing Lutyens’s work at the Hampstead Garden Suburb, with which his
association began in 1908, something should be said concerning the ‘Garden City’
movement<a id="r528"></a><a href='#f528' class='c025'><sup>[528]</sup></a> in general. In 1892 Ebenezer Howard<a id="r529"></a><a href='#f529' class='c025'><sup>[529]</sup></a> (1850-1928) published <i>Tomorrow.
A Peaceful Path to Reform</i>, better known by the title of the edition of 1902 as <i>Garden
Cities of Tomorrow</i>. Howard’s opportunity to realize his aspirations for a new sort of
town began with the acquisition of land at Letchworth in 1903, but the construction of
the Letchworth Garden City on the plans of Sir Raymond Unwin (1863-1940) and his
partner Richard Barry Parker actually post-dates their work at the Hampstead Garden
Suburb. They had, however, already laid out a ‘model village’ for a chocolate manufacturer
at New Earswick near York in 1904.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1907 Dame Henrietta Barnett set out to realize some aspects of the Garden City ideal
on the outskirts of London. The next year land was acquired near Golders Green on the
far side of Hampstead Heath and the suburb planned as a whole by Parker &amp; Unwin.<a id="r530"></a><a href='#f530' class='c025'><sup>[530]</sup></a>
Lutyens was invited to plan and design the group of public buildings in the centre and
their immediate setting (Figure <a href='#i406'>54</a>). This town centre was eventually largely completed,
most of it from Lutyens’s design, and the two churches, with the contiguous squares,
provide some of his finest work. His work here certainly set a pace of coherence and
urbanity that was unfortunately not maintained in later Garden Cities such as Welwyn,
begun in 1919, that followed the rather more diffuse plan of Letchworth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Welwyn, however, is of importance in the history of town-planning because it was
not merely a residential development but included from the first an industrial estate as
well. Thus it was a more complete entity and the prototype of the English ‘New Towns’
initiated after the Second World War. The Barnett project was originally, and has remained,
an upper-middle-class suburb; yet it is unique for the orderliness and the distinction
of the public buildings that Lutyens provided at the centre and the terrace-framed
squares that flank them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>St Jude’s, the Anglican church, begun in 1910 and not finally completed at the west
end until 1933, is Lutyens’s principal ecclesiastical work, his Catholic cathedral in Liverpool
having been barely begun before his death. Lacking the emotional drama of the
Scandinavian churches of its period, St Jude’s has nevertheless a certain real boldness of
silhouette, produced by rather eclectic means, and an elegance of craftsmanship in the
brickwork that is in the finest tradition of the Gothic Revival. Yet, being by Lutyens,
it is hardly at all medieval. The tall crossing tower may have slight suggestions of the
Norman in its detailing and a cathedral-like scale, but in general the exterior is in a
vaguely seventeenth-century vernacular descending from the later work of Shaw and
Webb.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The interior, rather surprisingly, proves to be almost High Renaissance in character;
there is even a barrel vault over the nave. On the other hand, the timberwork of
the roofs of the aisles, which descend so low on either side, is of a structural peculiarity
recalling Webb at his crankiest if not, indeed, Butterfield. Except for the highly
exceptional London church of the Holy Redeemer, Clerkenwell, built by J. D. Sedding
(1837-91) in 1887-8, so truly Palladian—rather than Anglo-Palladian—internally as
almost to persuade one that it is Italian, no non-Gothic church of this quality had been
built in England for two generations. Lutyens’s more modest Free Church is rather
similar, both inside and out, but considerably less effective.</p>

<p class='c010'>To surround two sides of both North Square and South Square beside the churches
Lutyens revived the Early Georgian terrace, varying the composition ingeniously and
handling the beautifully laid bricks in two colours, reddish and greyish, with a fascinating
subtlety. Unfortunately such truly urban housing stood no chance with the clientèle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>drawn to this and other Garden Cities as against the appeal of free-standing or semi-detached
houses. No general revival of the terrace occurred. But Parker &amp; Unwin
and their emulators achieved in individual houses a standard of semi-traditional suavity
that represents one of the principal English achievements of the period, and something
frequently imitated abroad.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lutyens’s call to lay out New Delhi as the capital of India followed in 1911, and the
first plans were made before 1914. It was a commission better suited to his leaping
imagination than the modest domesticity of an English Garden City. Construction of
the buildings, notably the enormous Viceroy’s House, began only in 1920.<a id="r531"></a><a href='#f531' class='c025'><sup>[531]</sup></a> Not since
L’Enfant laid out Washington had a fiat city of such amplitude and grandeur been conceived,
much less even partly executed. The Viceroy’s House, finally finished in 1931, is
official residence, centre of administration, and focus of the whole scheme—a <i>tour de
force</i> for which, from the Queen Anne, the Neo-Georgian, and the Palladian, Lutyens
lifted his sights to a Roman scale (Plate <a href='#pl181'>181</a>). The result is grand and broad, adapted to
the climate, and even reminiscent of the Indian architectural past in some of its forms
and features. Towards the designing of such a major monument generations of Frenchmen
and others who studied at the Beaux-Arts had been prepared; there is a certain
irony that this opportunity came to an Englishman, trained in the most private and
individualistic English way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nashdom and Great Maytham represent a side of Lutyens’s mature talent that follows
rather directly from Webb’s Smeaton Manor of the seventies (Plate <a href='#pl102a'>102<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). The work at
the Hampstead Garden Suburb, and above all that at Delhi, represents another side. On
the one side he had a few worthy rivals: Leonard A. S. Stokes (1858-1925)<a id="r532"></a><a href='#f532' class='c025'><sup>[532]</sup></a> was a
more adventurous architect than he around 1900, with some leaning towards the Art
Nouveau; Shaw’s pupil Newton was almost as competent at Neo-Georgian work.
Those who tried to rival him on the other side, however, Sir Reginald Blomfield
(1856-1942), a pupil of Norman Shaw, and Sir Herbert Baker (1862-1946), a pupil of
Ernest George, hardly deserve mention, even though their work bulks very large on
the London scene.</p>

<p class='c010'>Blomfield’s watered-down version of Shaw’s quadrant façade of the Piccadilly Hotel,
carried out in the twenties, has been mentioned. Better examples of what may be called
in W. S. Gilbert’s terms his ‘not too French, French’ academicism face Piccadilly Circus.
But his pretensions to cosmopolitanism, although based on a very considerable knowledge
of French seventeenth- and eighteenth-century architecture, did not serve him as
well as Lutyens’s purely English background in continuing along the ‘Monumental
Queen Anne’ line of Shaw’s late work.</p>

<p class='c010'>Baker’s outrageous rape of Soane’s masterpiece, the Bank of England, carried out over
the years 1921-37, has also been mentioned; it was literally a fate worse than death.
Despite a half-hearted decision to preserve a good deal of the relatively unimportant
exterior, the Tivoli Corner was pointlessly stripped of its idiosyncratic crown, presumably
in the name of Baker’s superior ‘taste’. His South Africa House of 1935, moreover,
all but ruins Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lutyens’s Midland Bank of 1924, near the Bank of England in Poultry, like Baker’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>bank almost a skyscraper in size if not in height, at least required the destruction of no
earlier work of distinction and is undoubtedly more consistently and personally designed.
Yet the cliff-like massiveness of its walls, with even less evidence of the underlying
structural skeleton than in office buildings of this period by American architects,
is almost as anti-urbanistic as Baker’s Bank of England. Because of the very narrow
streets of the area, the filling up of the City of London with such structures, very few of
them even of this degree of intrinsic interest, was a tragedy of the twenties that even
bombing did not put right. The superiority of Corbett’s Bush House, not in the rather
flat detailing but in the exploitation of the fine site at the foot of Kingsway, and even in
the politeness of the plain foil it offers to the Baroque elaboration of Gibbs’s St Mary-le-Strand,
is very notable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lutyens’s other big Midland Bank buildings, one of 1928 in Leadenhall Street in the
City and one of 1929 in King Street in Manchester, are not much of an improvement
over that in Poultry. However, his elegant little Midland Bank of 1922 in Piccadilly in
front of Wren’s St James’s is a rich and inventive exercise in the vein of Wren built of
brick and stone. Anachronistic as such a design must be considered, the verve of the
<i>pastiche</i> nevertheless has a distinct appeal, like a plausibly realistic setting on the stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lutyens’s most successful big business building is doubtless Britannic House of 1924-7.
This profits from its site between Finsbury Circus and Moorgate Street, the curve of the
Circus giving to the eastern front a certain major Baroque drama that is echoed in the
versatile play with seventeenth-eighteenth-century motifs in the detailing. But one may
well prefer the massively mock-Egyptian effect of Adelaide House by London Bridge,
built by Sir John Burnet &amp; Tait in 1924-5. This, at least, makes some approach to the
new ideals of the Continent in these years. Burnet, moreover, had been for decades one
of the most competent British practitioners in a local version of the international
Beaux-Arts mode, as his King Edward VII wing of the British Museum of 1904 notably
illustrates. Three years later Tait was the first English-born architect<a id="r533"></a><a href='#f533' class='c025'><sup>[533]</sup></a> to attempt
to build in the International Style, as has been mentioned earlier. The closest Lutyens
came to the Continental modes of the twenties was in his public housing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Public housing in England between the wars was generally rather routine in design
despite the statistical importance of its social achievement, lacking either the drama of
the Dutch or the restraint of the Scandinavians. On the one occasion when Lutyens
turned his attention to this field, on the Grosvenor Estate in Westminster in 1928, he
succeeded beyond all expectation. The bold device of chequering all the façades of
his blocks of flats in alternate oblongs of brickwork, plain stucco panels, and windows
is somewhat inhuman in scale but notably effective. The contrast is striking to the
work of the twenties by the London County Council Architect’s Office. In that a type of
design not unsuited to semi-detached houses in middle-class suburbs was spread thin
over vast many-storeyed masses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lutyens, one feels, in a different time and place—a generation earlier in England, say,
or a generation later—might have been a greater architect. But even as his career
actually worked out, he is not unworthy to occupy the place given him here as the ‘last
traditionalist’. Since his death there has not been, either in England or elsewhere, any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>traditional or even semi-traditional building of consequence, unless one wishes to consider
Perret’s work at Le Havre in the latter category.</p>

<p class='c010'>The traditional architecture of the first third of the twentieth century in Italy and
France, headquarters in so many ways of the major architectural traditions of the
western world, is disappointing beside that of the countries discussed so far. In the case
of France, the situation is confused by the modulation of Perret’s style towards a semi-traditional
Classicism which, by the thirties, official and academic taste was ready to
meet half-way. In Italy Marcello Piacentini (1881-1960), the son of the architect of the
Academy of Fine Arts in the Via Nazionale in Rome, always had more vitality than
the French of his generation other than Perret. From the new <i>città bassa</i> of Bergamo,
for which he won the competition in 1907 and which was executed in 1922-4, through
his general responsibility for the <i>Terza Roma</i>, Mussolini’s vast project for a new capital
between old Rome and Ostia which was to have opened with an exhibition in 1942,
there is a certain assurance and amplitude of scale lacking in most contemporary work
in France. Mussolini, in the middle years of Fascism, was not averse to modern architecture,
as we have seen. When, under German influence, he began to turn against the
International Style the choice of Piacentini to set a neo-imperial pace was as natural as
Hitler’s return to the modes of twenty years earlier in Germany. Moreover, from the
public buildings of Bergamo through the ‘New Towns’ below Rome—Littoria,
Sabaudia, Pontinia, etc., mostly destroyed during the Second World War—to the arcaded
cube of La Padulla’s Palace of Italian Civilization at the <i>Terza Roma</i>, nicknamed
by Italians the ‘Square Colosseum’, fine materials, clean if familiar proportions, and
excellent craftsmanship provide certain lasting qualities not unworthy of Italian national
traditions. Where Fascist work is interpolated in an earlier urbanistic scheme, as along the
Via Roma in Turin between the Piazza San Carlo and the Piazza Carlo Felice, the
new buildings of 1938—here by Piacentini—fit as well with the seventeenth-century
buildings of the one as with the nineteenth-century ones of the other. For all their
obviousness, moreover, the colonnades of the Via Roma, all of polished granite monoliths,
have a truly Roman scale and dignity. Even the Square Colosseum has a Chirico-like
obsessive force, like something out of a dream; while the big unfinished structures
around it, only now being completed, are not altogether without virtues to balance the
mid century conventionality of those that have lately risen beside them.</p>

<p class='c010'>To pursue the subject of traditional architecture further would be merely to explore
what can now be seen to have been not so much a cul-de-sac as a road without a goal.
The standards of traditionalism—standards of ‘taste’, of ‘literacy’, of ingenious adaptation—were
still on the whole nineteenth-century ones. Yet down into the thirties,
traditional buildings were the big trees in the forest of twentieth-century architecture;
with the rise of a new range of giants in the forest, the seedlings from which they grew
seem now to have been more significant: Asplund’s Stockholm Exhibition of 1930 and
his Crematorium there of 1935-40 tend to obscure our vision of his earlier Library,
although that is perhaps finer considered absolutely. So also the Philadelphia Savings
Fund Society skyscraper of 1932, so clearly the immediate ancestor of those built in the
last decade, draws attention away from the Woolworth Building. In England continuity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>has been so completely broken that it is hard to realize how much the ‘Mannerist’
façade-treatment of Drake &amp; Lasdun’s tall housing slabs of 1946-56 on the Paddington
Estate has in common with Lutyens’s chequered Grosvenor Estate blocks of thirty years
ago. However the future may evaluate the achievements of the traditional architects
of the early twentieth century, the chapter is now closed.</p>

  <h2 id='ch25' class='c013'><span class='c027'>CHAPTER 25</span><br />ARCHITECTURE AT THE MID CENTURY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>To</span> describe the state of architecture in the late forties and early fifties, before and after
the mid-point of this century, is far more difficult than to sketch its condition a hundred
and fifty years earlier, as the first chapter of this book attempted. The western world
was enormously larger in geographical extent, vastly more populous, and as a result
very much more productive of buildings of all types and at all levels of quality. Many
of the types most important in the twentieth century—big business buildings, low-cost
public housing, facilities for transportation such as bus stations and airports—did not
exist in 1800. These difficulties are objective and merely imply that the sampling of
executed work must be relatively much more limited. But the very limited selection
provided here is inevitably influenced by subjective criteria. The activity of two generations
of historians writing on the architecture of the early nineteenth century has produced
something approaching a consensus of opinion as to what is and what is not important
or characteristic in that period. There remains, of course, much to be discovered
concerning building in the decades around 1800, particularly as interest rises in the technical
aspects of the story; yet the engineers<a id="r534"></a><a href='#f534' class='c025'><sup>[534]</sup></a> are unlikely ever to force the Soanes and the
Schinkels out of the centre of the picture: moreover, men like Latrobe and Mills were
themselves as much engineers as architects.</p>
<p class='c010'>Already, in carrying the story of the production of the leading architects of the first
and second generations of modern architecture down to the mid fifties, a certain
emphasis has been given to their work in the production of the last decades. The decisions
as to what to include in rounding out the picture are critical ones hardly comparable
to the relatively objective historical process of selection that controls in the First and
Second Parts of this book. The very extent in time of what should be considered ‘the
present’ is a subjective matter. I have known American architectural students whose
present was so limited that they had never heard of Perret! To anyone under thirty the
effective present will hardly extend backward more than five or ten years. To keep this
chapter still more or less historical I have saved consideration of the years since the later
fifties for an <a href='#epi'>Epilogue</a>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In most countries of the western world the Second World War occasioned a hiatus
in construction that lasted nearly a full decade from the slowing down that came with
Munich in the late thirties to the general revival of building activity in the late forties.
There is therefore a real lack of continuity between pre-war and post-war building except
in those countries that remained neutral. But just as the break in the continuity
of building production around 1800 resulting from the Napoleonic Wars was a limited,
not an absolute, phenomenon, since the truly revolutionary developments in architecture
preceded rather than followed its onset, so there was in the last post-war period
very little to be recognized at first that had not had its beginnings well before 1939.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>The perspective of the war seemed somehow to flatten out some of the architectural
episodes deemed to be significant in the mid thirties, not alone the Nazi and late Fascist
reaction but such minor symptoms of dissatisfaction with the general line that architectural
development had taken internationally since the early twenties as the rise of the
Bay Region School<a id="r535"></a><a href='#f535' class='c025'><sup>[535]</sup></a> in America and of the New Empiricism in Europe. Historians
are still rather uncertain how much weight to give to these matters. Once they lost the
topicality of current events they seemed no more and no less significant than the rather
similar critical flurries that came later concerning the ‘New Brutalism’ and ‘Neo-Liberty’.<a id="r536"></a><a href='#f536' class='c025'><sup>[536]</sup></a>
Such flurries cannot be entirely ignored;<a id="r537"></a><a href='#f537' class='c025'><sup>[537]</sup></a> yet the general emendation of the
rigid doctrines of the ‘International Style’ was more strikingly illustrated by the continued
high esteem of Wright’s latest productions and, <i>a fortiori</i>, by the warm critical
reception of Le Corbusier’s remarkable church at Ronchamp than by any of the buildings
that illustrated the schismatic reactions of the decade of the thirties. The accepted
definitions of modern architecture had undoubtedly become very much looser than
they were a generation earlier, partly as a result of various abortive attempts
at more thoroughgoing revolt. But the greatest individualists were, paradoxically,
not young men<a id="r538"></a><a href='#f538' class='c025'><sup>[538]</sup></a> in their thirties, but older masters in their late sixties, seventies, and
eighties.</p>

<p class='c010'>The greatest change in the post-war architectural scene, a change that began gradually
during the pre-war years, was the shift in the geographical pattern. No longer did France,
Germany, and Holland occupy the centre of the stage. The rise of the United States to
great prominence, continuing a development already begun in the 1870s, was not
surprising. Far more surprising was the rise in the importance of Italy and Japan, not
only because of their actual achievements, especially in concrete construction in both
cases, but as major influences. This was presaged in Italy by the work of Terragni and
of Figini &amp; Pollini in the mid thirties and was hardly inhibited there by the ambiguities
of the later Fascist attitude towards architecture just before the Second World War.
The post-war British achievement was more canalized; yet it was of an autochthonous
character which a long-term consideration of English architectural abilities and disabilities
makes more intelligible than that flurry of new ideas, so largely of foreign
origin, characterizing the mid thirties in England.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Scandinavian countries retained their position of prominence but not pre-eminence
in the international architectural scene. In contrast to their long-recognized virtues,
some rather less relevant today than they once were, must be set the very different
contribution of the Latin American countries, whose entry on the international scene all
but post-dates the war. Production there was hardly worth mentioning a hundred and
fifty years ago; by the late forties Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela were
making a contribution on a par, in quantity and even in quality, with older and richer
countries. Moreover, while the West was more and more losing political control of
Africa and Asia, its cultural influence on those continents did not necessarily decline,
indeed as regards architecture it probably increased. Modern architecture, originally
developed to utilize to the full the most advanced technologies, was found to serve
especially well also in areas where technology was least advanced. Indeed, the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>characteristic building material of modern architecture, ferro-concrete, is often exploited
most ingeniously in countries where materials are dear and labour cheap.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not only did many outlying parts of the world import architects along with other
technicians from the West; Asia, which lay almost entirely outside the field of western
culture a century and a half ago, produced a great modern school in Japan. Various
Dominions and dependencies—South Africa, Australia, Puerto Rico, for example—likewise
began to have active groups of local practitioners operating in close consort of
principle with those of Europe and North America.</p>

<p class='c010'>With so wide a range of lively activity, no continent-by-continent, much less country-by-country,
survey of modern architecture is possible in a single short chapter. Even
allowing for all the enormous climatic and cultural differences that still affect architectural
production, there was still sufficient identity of principle in architecture throughout
most of the world to justify an international consideration of post-war achievement in
terms of various building types, moving from the macrocosm down to the microcosm—from
the whole city as a planned product of architectural design to the individual
dwelling-house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite its vast productive capacity, the old western world in the mid twentieth
century created rather fewer urban entities of distinction than did the nineteenth.
Partly, this was because the building of cities necessarily remains a slower process than
the building of individual structures, even in an age when there are many fiat towns and
also much concerted rebuilding of older cities partially cleared by bombing in the
Second World War. Even more, perhaps, it is because it takes far longer for the ‘planning’
ideals of architects in any period to achieve a degree of public acceptance sufficient
to ensure over decades proper control of layout and construction—or reconstruction—of
whole cities than to find clients, even governmental clients, for single buildings or for
extensive, but piecemeal, social projects.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perret’s Le Havre (Plate <a href='#pl140a'>140<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) has earlier been characterized as the realization—notable
even if belated—of ideals that date back before the First World War. None of
the post-war ‘New Towns’ of England were complete enough by the mid fifties to be
apprehensible as urban entities; for the most part they were still only large-scale housing
developments—suburbs in search of a city, so to say—realizing at a considerably lower
economic level the ideals of the Garden Cities of fifty years before. Better than the
English examples and indicative of the widespread acceptance of Garden-City ideals
was Vållingby in Sweden.</p>

<p class='c010'>More complete urban entities of the mid century could be seen in such heavily
bombed and largely rebuilt cities as Coventry in England or Hanover in Germany;
yet in neither case was the architectural achievement of the highest contemporary order.
They should be compared for quality with Napoleon III’s Paris or Francis Joseph’s
Vienna rather than with Alexander I’s Petersburg or Ludwig I’s Munich, and even that
comparison is not always very favourable to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the extensive and almost explosive expansion and reconstruction of various Latin
American cities it was only in Caracas that the planner Maurice Rotival was able to keep
a bit ahead of the builders. But even Caracas still had only samples of the characteristic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>new urbanism of the mid twentieth century: two or three isolated skyscrapers and a
housing development, the Cerro Piloto, differing from those in other parts of the world
chiefly by its very great extent and its superb mountain-backed site. The North American
cities that were growing fastest, Houston or Los Angeles or Miami Beach or Toronto
in Canada, were at least as chaotic as the Latin American ones, and neither the quantity
nor the quality of the individual buildings was as high. Against the eruptive growth of
a city like São Paulo in Brazil might be better balanced such a North American programme
of large-scale rebuilding as that which had already cleared the Golden Triangle
in Pittsburgh, replacing typical nineteenth-century urban congestion with an open
park and spaced cruciform skyscrapers. The new capital of Brazil, Brasilia, was not
planned by Lúcio Costa even on paper until 1957.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mid twentieth century had no full-scale cities that properly exemplified the
highest ideals of modern architects. It would be necessary to wait, with fingers crossed,
even to see the results of such piecemeal projects of reconstruction as that proposed by
Sir William Holford for the bombed district around St Paul’s Cathedral in London,<a id="r539"></a><a href='#f539' class='c025'><sup>[539]</sup></a> and
still longer for such complete cities as Brasilia and Chandigarh where, however, the
public buildings by Le Corbusier were in the mid fifties rapidly rising. But there were
also in existence already certain special entities of almost urban scale planned since the
Second World War that deserve attention. Notable are the ‘university cities’, complete
educational plants located on new terrain, planned as a whole and designed as regards
their individual buildings either by a single team of architects or by several teams whose
work was closely co-ordinated from start to finish. The most remarkable of these is
that of the University of Mexico, but even here the difference in quality between such
highly original structures as the Olympic Stadium of Augusto Perez Palacios (b. 1909),
Raúl Salinas Moro, and Jorge Bravo Jiménez of 1951-2, with its fine relief mosaic by
Diego Rivera, or the Central Library of Juan O’Gorman, Gustavo Saavedra, and Juan
Martinez de Velasco of 1951-3, with its stack tower entirely covered with mosaics designed
by O’Gorman, and certain of the other equally large and prominent buildings is
very notable (Plate <a href='#pl184'>184</a>). The university city of Rio de Janeiro, for which Le Corbusier
was originally called to Brazil to provide a plan in 1936, was by no means so far advanced;
but the control of the design of all the principal buildings by one architect, Jorge Moreira
(b. 1904), who is one of the three or four ablest in Brazil, seemed to promise a homogeneity
of character and a distinction of finish unique in this field. Among several other
Latin American examples begun and partly built by the mid fifties, that at Caracas by
Carlos Raúl Villanueva (b. 1900) rivals in its principal building, the Aula Magna of
1952-3 with its extraordinary acoustic ceiling by the technician Robert Newman and
the sculptor Sandy Calder, the achievement of the Mexicans.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of a very different character indeed, and initiated much earlier, is the University of
Aarhus<a id="r540"></a><a href='#f540' class='c025'><sup>[540]</sup></a> in Denmark for which Kay Fisker, C. F. Møller (b. 1898), and Povl Stegmann
(1888-1944) won the competition in 1931. Some of its many buildings date from
before the Second World War: professors’ houses of 1933, student residences of 1934,
museum of natural history of 1937-8; while most of the classroom buildings were
actually erected in the war years 1942-6. The work continues in the hands of Møller,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>and the layout of the beautiful sloping site was by C. Th. Sørenson (b. 1893). Built of buff
brick with tile roofs of medium pitch, the general effect is much quieter than that of the
Latin American university cities with their tall ferro-concrete buildings, crisply shaped
and distinguished both by a bold use of colour and the conspicuous incorporation of
work by distinguished painters and sculptors. At first sight—and to the prejudiced—the
University of Aarhus may appear more conservative; but the range of the new architecture
is recognized today as being wider than it was thirty years ago, and Møller’s
<i>aula</i> in its very different way is quite as advanced as Villanueva’s; or even, for that matter,
as the shell-domed auditorium of 1952-5 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in Cambridge, Mass., by Eero Saarinen (1910-61).</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the earliest individual building types to find wholly untraditional expression
was the large block of offices. The skyscraper reached maturity early in the hands of
Sullivan in Chicago; the later vagaries of the form in New York did not recommend it
to European emulation, although skyscraper projects by Mies, by Gropius, and by Le
Corbusier were among the most notable early evidences of the birth—on paper—of a
new architecture in the years 1919-22. Howe &amp; Lescaze’s Philadelphia Savings Fund
Society Building of a decade later was the first large-scale example of the acceptance in
America of the new architecture of Europe; but during the thirties skyscraper-building
languished, and many critics thought that their day was already over. In many parts of
the world that day had yet to dawn, and Europe still had very few notable examples to
offer, but in the New World the fifties saw the start of a new wave of skyscraper building
by no means confined to the United States. For the first time since the nineties a
rather considerable number of really distinguished examples were being built in both
North and South American cities. Wright’s Price Tower at Bartlesville, Okla., a relatively
modest one, and Mies and Johnson’s Seagram Building in New York have both
been mentioned already. Diagonally across Park Avenue in New York from the site of
the Seagram tower stands the first epoch-making post-war skyscraper in New York,
Lever House, designed by Gordon Bunshaft (b. 1909) of the Skidmore, Owings &amp;
Merrill firm and built in 1950-2 (Plate <a href='#pl189'>189</a>). The almost completely glazed curtain-walls
of the east and west sides of the United Nations Secretariat in New York—built in 1947-50
by Wallace K. Harrison (b. 1895) and his partner Max Abramowitz (b. 1908) but
incorporating ideas provided by an international panel of which Le Corbusier and
Niemeyer were members—are carried round three sides of Bunshaft’s slab. More significant,
however, is the fact that this slab, rising like the isolated United Nations building
with no setbacks, covers only a portion of the available site. Thus it stands in its own
envelope of space carved, as it were, out of the solid canyon of Park Avenue, just as
Mies and Johnson would later set their building back 100 feet from the avenue and well
in from both the side streets also. Their ‘plaza’ is unconfined; Bunshaft’s open space
is defined by a mezzanine on <i>pilotis</i> carried round an unroofed court.</p>

<p class='c010'>Reacting against the almost totally glazed curtain-wall of his U.N. Secretariat, a type
of sheathing for large urban structures then spreading very rapidly to other countries,
Harrison on the Alcoa Building of 1952 in Pittsburgh used storey-high panels of aluminium
cut by relatively small windows. This alternative type of sheathing has been less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>exploited since, however, than the more completely glazed sort. There was a curious
revival of Expressionist feeling in the complex angular design of the glazed lobby of the
Alcoa Building that contrasted sharply with the paradigmatic expression of the ‘International
Style’ seen in the Equitable Building in Portland, Ore., of 1948 by Pietro
Belluschi (b. 1899), the earliest of the interesting post-war skyscrapers. A later Western
skyscraper, the Mile-High Center in Denver, Col., completed by I. M. Pei (b. 1907) in
1955, followed almost more closely the formula of Mies’s Lake Shore Drive Apartments
in Chicago than he did himself in the design of the Seagram Building.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is invidious to mention only these few North American examples, but production
of similar skyscrapers was already so nation-wide in the United States and in Canada
that one can still hardly hope to see the individual trees for the forest. There are good
reasons why those selected for illustration or mention are likely to remain conspicuous
and not become lost in the crowd. But skyscrapers are no longer a prerogative of North
America; some of the finest were rising in Latin America, and these would before long
be rivalled by European examples already projected or even under construction by 1955.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a mistake to assume that North Americans housed business only in skyscrapers.
More and more large corporations were moving their headquarters to the open country.
Quite as significant as Lever House in the production of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill in
the mid fifties was the 700-foot-square but only four-storeyed office plant of the
Connecticut General Insurance Company of 1955-7, set in a park of eighteenth-century
size and amenity at Bloomfield, Conn., some ten miles outside Hartford, the insurance
capital. Luxury of materials, white marble and granite as well as aluminium, makes up
somewhat for the rigid asceticism of the standardized walls, while four interior court
gardens by Noguchi and three pink granite figures by him on the slope beyond the
‘artificial water’ in which swans swim about below the all-glass cafeteria further balance
the expression of crisp efficiency with something warmer and more humane.</p>

<p class='c010'>In most Latin American cities all-glass walls are impractical because of the heat and the
glare of the sun. As a result, architects have developed various versions of the sun-break
system introduced twenty years ago on the first tall modern building to be erected in
that part of the world, the Ministry of Education in Rio; glazed curtain-walls were by
no means unknown, however. The egg-crate sun-breaks of the Edificio C.B.I. of 1948-51
in São Paulo by Lucjan Korngold (b. 1897) and the horizontally patterned grid of the
Retiro Odontológico of 1953-4 in Havana by Antonio Quintana Simonetti and
Manuel A. Rubio give these buildings a very different look from such examples of more
North American character as the building in the Calle de Niza at the corner of the Calle
de Londres in Mexico City of 1952-3 by Juan Sordo Madaleno (b. 1916), or that of
the Suramericana de Seguros in the Avenida Jiménez de Quesada in Bogotá of 1954 by
Cuéllar, Serrano, Gomez &amp; Co.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most ingenious and best designed Latin American skyscraper of the fifties, however,
is the completely isolated Edificio Polar of 1953-4 at the Plaza Venezuela in Caracas.
This was built by Martin Vegas Pacheco (b. 1926), a pupil of Mies at the Illinois Institute
of Technology, and his partner José Miguel Galia, a pupil of the one distinguished
South American architect of the first modern generation, Julio Vilamajó, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>the University of Montevideo. Here the structure was reduced to four ferro-concrete
piers from which the curtain-walls were cantilevered out 11 feet on all four sides. The
curtain-walls have a varied infilling, part solid sandwiches of plywood and aluminium
sheeting, part louvres that transmit air but not light, and part glass. These are combined
in different proportions on each side according to the orientation in order to control
the glare and the heat of the sun while providing direct ventilation. Since this tower
was isolated, it needed no envelope of space; in fact, however, the wider mezzanine
extending under the base of the tower does provide this. The two open storeys, one at
ground level and one above the mezzanine, give a lightness of effect and a frank view
of the essential structure that is even more striking than at Lever House, where the
relation of the towering slab to the mezzanine is less boldly handled.</p>

<p class='c010'>European skyscrapers<a id="r541"></a><a href='#f541' class='c025'><sup>[541]</sup></a> as yet rarely rivalled North American ones in height, and
few large urban office buildings reached even the median level of quality of those in
Latin America. In rebuilding bombed cities, however, there were opportunities that
could readily be exploited for carrying certain buildings very high over a portion only
of their sites, as was first done in North America at Lever House, but using the ampler
spaces provided by the replanning of the cities to extend lower blocks from the main
slab. One of the best examples of this treatment is the Continental Rubber Building of
1952-3 in Hanover by Werner Dierschke and Ernst Zinsser, which replaces Behrens’s
ponderous block of thirty years earlier that was destroyed in the war. The surfacing
materials, mostly various stones, are serviceable and the general composition well studied,
but the proportions lack the elegant lightness of the Edificio Polar. Yet the whole
achieved a ‘reality’ of effect lacking in the C.B.I. in São Paulo, which looks, despite its
great size, rather like a cardboard model; or Lever House, which too much resembles a
slick cellophane-wrapped package. Some German commercial work at smaller scale
was more refined, as, for example, the Haus der Glas-Industrie of 1951 at Düsseldorf by
Bernhard Pfau and Pempelfort Haus there of 1954 by Hentrich &amp; Petschnigg, or the
Burda-Moden Building of the same date in Offenburg by Egon Eiermann. Hentrich &amp;
Petschnigg are also responsible for the striking BASF skyscraper at Ludwigshafen, the
tallest built in the Old World up to the mid fifties.</p>

<p class='c010'>Post-war Italian commercial work was more varied and imaginative than in other
countries, but the tallest examples were not the best. Very often it was the fine marble
or mosaic surfacing—echoed in the BASF—and the high quality of the craftsmanship
that seemed to give them interest and an effect of luxury rarely yet found in other
countries, rather than real distinction of design. Interestingly enough, since post-war
Latin America has tended to follow Italian models, one of the best Italian buildings of
this decade, the Olivetti offices in Milan of 1954-5 by G. A. Bernasconi, Annibale
Fiocchi (b. 1915), and M. Nizzoli, has a very Latin American air because of its prominent
sun-breaks. This was one of the few buildings premiated by the international jury at the
São Paulo Biennal in 1957, and the only non-Brazilian one.</p>

<p class='c010'>Industrial construction has not even yet been as fully accepted into the realm of architecture
as has commercial building for the last hundred years. Ever since the factories of
Behrens and the warehouses of Perret, however, industrial commissions have played an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>increasingly important part in modern architectural production. Probably the largest
acreage of good factory-building just after the war, as earlier in the century, was in
North America. With rising standards of amenity, moreover, and the substitution of road
haulage for rail transportation, factories came out from behind the railway tracks and
took their proper place visually as well as functionally, with well-maintained grounds
as important features, in regional planning. It is hard to single out particular factories
for mention, if only because their design, whether it is by engineers or by specialist
architectural firms like Albert Kahn, Inc., had arrived at a largely anonymous standardization—the
fate, incidentally, towards which some critics see all twentieth-century
architecture as inevitably moving.</p>

<p class='c010'>The General Motors Technical Institute at Warren, Mich., completed by Eero
Saarinen in 1955 after a decade of planning and construction, is almost more comparable
in scale and complexity to a university city than to a factory; yet this group of twenty-five
buildings organized round a large rectangular artificial lake is also in its use and in
its character a major example of American industrial building raised at the behest of a
corporate client into the realm of distinguished architecture
(Plate <a href='#pl168b'>168<span class='fss'>B</span></a>; Figure 55). Little
or no link remained between this and even the latest buildings designed by Eliel Saarinen
on which his son collaborated, although the former was involved in this commission
down to his death in 1950. Instead, the influence of Mies was very strong, since in the
younger Saarinen’s estimation the Miesian discipline was specially suitable for giving order
to such a project, in terms both of over-all planning and of the characteristic structural
vocabulary of curtain-walling. Yet the necessary variety of size and shape of the buildings,
determined in part by the very different activities that they house, from power-houses
and engine-test cells to the Styling Centre for new motor-car models, made impossible
the imposition of so classic a pattern as Mies had aimed to produce at the
Illinois Institute of Technology (Figure <a href='#i389'>52</a>). In conscious avoidance of the monotony of
the motor-car factories around Detroit, which run on without modification for thousands
of feet, and in pursuit of ideals which most modern planners have realized only on
paper, Eero Saarinen accented his long lake-front with a water-tower all of stainless steel
rising out of the water and provided a special domed unit at the south end to house the
display of new models beside the one section of the complex to which the outside
world has some access. Moreover, he varied the characteristic metal-and-glass vocabulary
of the façades—the metal in general black oxidized aluminium, the glass greenish
in tone to reduce glare in the interiors—with solid walls of glazed brick in various brilliant
colours, almost rivalling the Mexicans in the intensity of the reds, blues, yellows,
and greens that he chose. As with the later Connecticut General plant, sculpture of distinction,
here by Antoine Pevsner, provides a note of humane interest amid all the expression
of mechanistic efficiency.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Europe the Olivetti Company were more consistent patrons of distinguished design
in architecture than General Motors. The main plant at Ivrea, designed by Figini &amp;
Pollini, is small by American standards, and has been in existence for some time—since
1942. It is chiefly notable because it is the heart, as it is the <i>raison d’être</i>, of an
architectural programme of almost urbanistic scope at Ivrea that is still in process of</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>realization by Figini &amp; Pollini and by the resident architect Fiocchi, whose small foundry
of 1954-5 is an exemplary industrial unit of almost Miesian elegance. Characteristic
now of most Latin countries are the sun-breaks on the south-west side of the large Ivrea
factory; while the north-east façade rises four storeys in sheer glass like a vast extension
of Gropius’s studio block at the Bauhaus. Of the present period of the fifties, and better
sited, more articulated, and more self-complete, is the later Olivetti factory at Pozzuoli
near Naples by Luigi Cosenza. Structurally, however, the industrial work of the engineer
Nervi is more original.</p>

<p class='c010'>Factories are still more likely to be designed by engineers than by architects; but the
contribution of engineers to their design is by no means always standardized and monotonous.
Particularly in those countries where the lack of steel encourages the use of
ferro-concrete, engineers were devising notably imaginative solutions to the problems of
space-coverage and lighting. The Spanish-born engineer Candela in Mexico worked
with ferro-concrete vaults in industrial construction with the casual ease and <i>ad hoc</i> ingenuity
of a twelfth-century Frenchman building in stone; yet his church of Nuestra
Señora de los Milagros of 1953-5 gave the impression of being a reversion to Expressionism,
despite the unassailable mathematical and structural logic of the hyperbolic
paraboloid forms of its ‘ruled surfaces’. The Italian-born José Delpini, in such factories
as his S.I.T. Spinning Shed of 1949-50 at Pilar in Argentina, easily rivalled the work of
the leading modern architects of Argentina in the distinction as in the scale of his buildings.
The Danish-born Ore Arup in England, working with the Architects Co-Partnership
on the artificial rubber factory at Bryn Mawr in Wales, provided one of the most
notable large-scale buildings in post-war Great Britain, and deserves much of the credit
for it. To return to the work of architects, it should be noted that in England, where
most post-war industrial building was rather modest in size, the power-stations of Farmer
&amp; Dark, culminating in that of 1955-7 at Marchwood, have a grandeur of scale
and a logic of partially open design that ordinary factories can almost never rival.</p>

<p class='c010'>Industrial building, still at the frontier of architecture despite the great contribution it
has made to more general developments since the English mills of the 1790s, was notably
international in its twentieth-century standards and its achievements. The leading industrial
firms, such as Albert Kahn, Inc., and that of Frankland Dark were asked to build in
many parts of the world, for the traditions of the old-established technologies are of
especial value in such work. The continued existence of cultural empires, so to call them,
is still made manifest when English firms build power-houses and factories in the Middle
and Far East. James Cubitt &amp; Partners<a id="r542"></a><a href='#f542' class='c025'><sup>[542]</sup></a> completed in Rangoon in 1955, for example, a
pharmaceutical plant that was probably the largest post-war factory of architectural interest
to be built by an English firm, just as their Technical College at Kumasi in Ghana
built at the same time was a more considerable example of a mid-twentieth-century
university city than England had yet seen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The provision of housing by organs of the State had come to be recognized almost
everywhere as an essential social service, quite as modern architects always insisted that
it should be. Le Corbusier’s Unité at Marseilles is doubtless the most striking single
example of the tall structures, slabs or ‘point-blocks’, which were increasingly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>characteristic form of such housing, but the most notable general programmes of production
were still found in England, in certain Latin American countries, and in Denmark
and Sweden. The pressure of population-growth and the need for rebuilding after
war-time destruction motivated such programmes almost everywhere, but in several
countries notable otherwise for the high standard of their current architecture—the
United States and Italy, for example—the results were disappointing indeed. A strong
social tradition of public housing, moreover, as in Holland, even with the precedent
there of the notably fine work of thirty and forty years ago, seemed then to be no
guarantee of continued excellence in this field. Although the rising popularity of housing
in tall structures is still balanced in England by a strong attachment to small houses built
in pairs or in terraces, such as comprise the greater part of the New Towns, English
achievement in this field on the whole exceeded that of most other countries in the ten
years after the war, both in quantity and in quality. The post-war pace was set by the
Churchill Gardens of A. J. Philip Powell (b. 1921) and his partner Hidalgo Moya in
Pimlico, London, for which the Westminster Borough Council was the client. For over a
decade the planning and building of this vast urban project went forward towards completion
with rising standards of design and finish. Perhaps the finest single block is De
Quincey House, with its ingenious section of duplexes approached by access galleries.
But the Architect’s Department of the London County Council, under the successive
leadership of Robert Matthew (b. 1906) and of Sir Leslie Martin (b. 1908), in the last
seven years equalled and perhaps exceeded in quality, as many times over in quantity, the
achievement of Powell &amp; Moya. Whether on urban sites, such as that at Loughborough
Road in South London (Plate <a href='#pl186b'>186<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), or on more open sites, as at the Ackroydon estate
in Putney or at Roehampton, by the combination of tall blocks, some square in plan,
some slab-like, with ranges of lower blocks of maisonettes and terraces of houses the
L.C.C. has provided—piecemeal at least—examples of mid-twentieth-century urbanism
more impressive than anything the New Towns yet offered. A provincial English
example of comparable excellence is the Tile Hill Estate outside Coventry by the
Borough Architect’s Office.</p>

<p class='c010'>The forty-eight slabs of the Cerro Piloto development of 1955 built by the Banco
Obrero, the Venezuelan public housing corporation, and designed by Guido Bermudez
(b. 1925), rising against the mountains outside Caracas more than rival in extent and in
scale the English examples. And in the Cerro Grande blocks of flats there, built in
1953-5, Bermudez rivalled the ingenuity of Powell &amp; Moya and the L.C.C. in the
use of duplexes. Interesting for the mixture of types—tall slabs, lower blocks of flats,
and houses—is the Centro Urbano Presidente Juarez in Mexico City by Mario Pani
(b. 1901); the handsome colours used here were chosen by the painter Carlos Mérida. But
the most exemplary of the Latin American estates is Pedregulho outside Rio de Janeiro
begun in 1948 by Affonso Eduardo Reidy (b. 1909). Here the tall serpentine block at
the rear is entered at middle level from the hill slope, a scheme suggested by certain of Le
Corbusier’s projects of the thirties for North Africa, and various community buildings
provide something of New Town character in the development, as does a range of
low blocks with shops at their base in the Tile Hill Estate at Coventry. Most notable is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>Reidy’s school at Pedregulho with its murals of <i>azulejos</i>—glazed tiles—by Cándido
Portinari and its characteristic repertory of the architectural forms of the Cariocan
School. Of that Reidy, a member of the original group who designed and built the
Ministry of Education, was as much one of the founders as Oscar Niemeyer.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the mid twentieth century, however, it is England that leads in school design
and construction even more definitely than in the design of tall housing blocks. In
particular, the Hertfordshire County Architect’s Office under C. H. Aslin (1893-1959)
developed a system of construction using a light-metal skeleton and prefabricated concrete
slabs of very great technical interest. Not all the Hertfordshire schools are designed
in the County Architect’s Office, however, and some of the best were by private architects,
such as the Architects’ Co-partnership and James Cubitt &amp; Partners (Plate <a href='#pl186a'>186<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
The new architecture has been more widely and successfully used for schools than for
most other types of buildings. Outside England those of Donald Barthelmé in Texas,
such as his Elementary School at West Columbia of 1952, and by Ernest J. Kump
(b. 1911) in California may be especially noted, although they represent no such concerted
programme of design and construction as has spread in England from Hertfordshire
to other parts of the country. Outright ‘traditional’ schools are rare anywhere today.</p>

<p class='c010'>In church architecture the post-war situation was rather different. Although Perret
and Wright, Moser and Böhm, among the older generation of modern architects, all
built notable churches, until Le Corbusier’s Notre-Dame-du-Haut at Ronchamp the
international leaders of the next generation were rarely called on to design them; and
from Oud’s church of the late twenties at Oud Mathenesse through Mies’s Chapel of
1950 at the Illinois Institute of Technology it seemed that the extreme rationalism
of these men made it difficult if not impossible for them to provide ecclesiastical
edifices which differed in any expressive way from meeting-halls. Something was said
earlier of the more emotional concrete-vaulted church architecture of Böhm and
the line of related advance in the last two decades from the semi-traditional, somewhat
Gothic or Baroque, effects of the twenties to work of completely original character.
Niemeyer’s São Francisco at Pampulha (Plate <a href='#pl190c'>190<span class='fss'>C</span></a>), completed in 1943, was one of the
buildings that early established his reputation as one of the most imaginative architects
of his generation anywhere in the world. Soon Latin American churches as different
as Candela’s Nuestra Señora de los Milagros in Mexico City and the unvaulted Beato
Martín Porres at Cataño outside San Juan in Puerto Rico by Henry Klumb (b. 1905), a
pupil of Wright, were illustrating a wider range of possibilities; while Juvenal Moya’s
Nuestra Señora de Fatimá and his chapel at the Ginnásio Moderno in Bogotá, the one
of 1953-4, the other of 1954-5, followed—with considerable vulgarization—the more
lyrical line of Niemeyer’s São Francisco.</p>

<p class='c010'>Less operatic, but doubtless better adapted to Protestant use, are the churches in the
American Northwest by Belluschi, notably the First Presbyterian of 1951 at Cottage
Grove in Oregon. Various Swiss churches, some Catholic but more of them Protestant,
followed also in this line, to which such earlier-mentioned churches as Moser’s Sankt
Antonius in Basel of 1927 and the elder Saarinen’s Christ Lutheran, Minneapolis, of
1948 belong (Plate <a href='#pl157b'>157<span class='fss'>B</span></a>). The younger Saarinen’s silo-like circular chapel of red brick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of 1954-5, however, reverted to something
much more emotional. There is great ingenuity in the handling of the lighting,
which streams down from above over a screen by Harry Bertoia and also penetrates
more subtly round the edges of the low-arched base through the water of a surrounding
moat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Johnson’s synagogue in Port Chester, N.Y., of 1955-6, while severe in its general
character, uses coloured glass in slots between the vertical slabs with which the visible
steel frame is filled and also a curved awning-like ceiling of plaster to warm and enrich
the basically Miesian paradigm. Accessories by the sculptor Ibrahim Lassaw also play
an important part in the interior; while the oval domed entrance vestibule is an element
of almost Baroque formal interest despite its ascetic simplicity of execution. Thus,
two Mies disciples have offered in their ecclesiastical work correctives to the classroom-like
coldness of his own chapel in Chicago.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such large-scale constructions as factories and tall housing blocks, together with skyscrapers,
represent the new architecture’s preoccupation with building problems that
the nineteenth century had already essayed, but of which the development was not
carried to its logical extremes, either technically or architecturally, before the present
period. Curiously enough, in the provision of new edifices to serve the needs of
transportation, the nineteenth century in its middle decades was rather more successful
in bringing the railway station to quite early maturity than was the twentieth century
with the airport. One of the largest and finest post-war buildings of Italy is the Rome
railway station (Plate <a href='#pl183b'>183<span class='fss'>B</span></a>), and within a few years the active campaign of modernizing
and rebuilding stations in Italy was notably reflected in other European countries. But
airports had still to find so satisfactory an expression, partly because the expansion of
traffic everywhere made them inadequate almost before they were completed. Too
often the necessity for continual extension has destroyed such integrity of conception as
the architects were able to give them in the first place. Some of the world’s busiest, such
as Idlewild near New York and Midway near Chicago, were through the nineteen
fifties near-shambles beside which century-old railway stations appeared as masterpieces
of up-to-date organization! Here, as in many other fields of contemporary building,
there seem to be two main lines of approach, but not properly to be distinguished as
‘rational’ versus ‘emotional’, since both are almost entirely dependent on the structural
solutions chosen. Of the first sort a relatively early example (which now carries only
local traffic and has therefore not had to be expanded), the Santos Dumont Airport by
the Roberto brothers begun in 1938 and largely completed after 1944 at the bay’s edge
in downtown Rio de Janeiro, remains one of the best; for it is compactly planned, clear
and direct in design, and elegant in the choice of materials and the use of colour. The San
Juan Airport completed in 1955 by Torro, Ferrer &amp; Torregrossa<a id="r543"></a><a href='#f543' class='c025'><sup>[543]</sup></a> in Puerto Rico is
larger and somewhat less refined in detail, but an excellent example of planning in terms
of circulation. The vast London Airport by Gibberd was still incomplete.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two other airports of much the same date, the very large one at St Louis by
Minoru Yamasaki (b. 1912) and Joseph W. Leinweber, and the small one by Pani
and his partner Enrique del Moral at Acapulco, used concrete shell vaults with very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>dramatic effect. It would seem that the ‘classic’ stage of airport design, reached in railway
stations between 1845 and 1855, was only beginning in the late fifties, and its
climax may well lie many years ahead.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the airport to the individual dwelling, from the newest sort of structure to what
is presumably the oldest, represents a considerable jump. Yet it is at least debatable
whether the best houses of the mid twentieth century, continuing a line of development
that has earlier been traced forward from 1800 (see Chapter <a href='#ch15'>15</a>), were not more satisfactory
solutions of the problems their designing and building poses, both practically
and aesthetically, than any of the airports mentioned. To a considerable extent they were
as novel.<a id="r544"></a><a href='#f544' class='c025'><sup>[544]</sup></a> The dwelling may not, in the years after 1925, have developed primarily as a
‘machine for living in’, according to Le Corbusier’s famous phrase, but it certainly
became more and more a ‘box for housing machinery in’. As the relative proportion
of the total cost spent for mechanical equipment went up, the shell had to shrink. As the
shell shrank, planning was increasingly simplified. Only rarely was the ultimate in unification
of space reached, as in Mies’s Farnsworth house or Philip Johnson’s own house in
New Canaan, Conn., where only the bathroom is enclosed and the other subdivisions
of the interior are but ranges of cupboards not reaching to the ceiling. Equally rare is
the exclusively glass walling of these two houses, clearly the extreme point of a <i>crescendo</i>
that goes back at least to the window-walls of the third quarter of the nineteenth
century. But if they represented the end-point of several developments, from which
there has since been a return even on the part of their own architects (Plate <a href='#pl190a'>190<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), the
extremes that they illustrate were in many respects those towards which houses in general
were then tending.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house as a detached, individually-designed edifice was still for most people the
ideal dwelling. But at no time since 1800 had such a dwelling been more of a luxury.
Convenience and economy drove rich and poor alike towards more communal forms of
habitation, whether they were the cabañas of the millionaires’ motels at Palm Springs or
the low-cost flats in suburban ‘point-blocks’. In between these poles were all the varieties
of terrace-housing, ‘semi-detachery’, and builders’ standardized products, ranging from
conservative parodies of the individually designed houses of a generation ago through
various vulgarizations of more modern houses to the prefabricated package-dwelling
which seemed to be no nearer to receiving that general acceptance which would make it
economical than it was a hundred years ago. Mass housing, no matter what form it
took, whether the forty-eight tall slabs of the Cerro Piloto or the forty-eight hundred,
more or less, semi-detached two-storey dwellings of an English housing estate, belongs
increasingly to the world of bureaucratized architecture. The house, on the other
hand, conceived as an individualized entity, remained almost as much a specialized and
exceptional product as the church; yet the changes first made in individual houses
gradually affected all housing standards. Particularly in North and South America
they still provided architectural opportunities of the greatest interest and variety. Most
Latin American houses, for example, retained the semi-oriental ideals of seclusion of the
Iberian tradition; yet behind the walls surrounding their plots to cut out the world, they
were often opener than houses in the United States, since a warm climate makes of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>patio or garden the principal living area. Niemeyer’s own house of 1954 at Gávea outside
Rio de Janeiro is almost as much a glass box as Mies’s or Johnson’s, although its
glass walls are set under a slab whose outline is a continuous free curve. The house of
Osvaldo Arthur Bratke (b. 1907) at 3008 Avenida Morumbí outside São Paulo is also
closer in plan and conception to houses in the United States, protection of various sorts
being provided by grilles and movable shutters (Figure <a href='#i425'>56</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>There was considerable variety in mid-century house-design in Latin America, ranging
all the way from such Mexican houses as those of Francisco Artigas (b. 1916) or
Sordo Madaleno that present a blank wall to the street and yet open up completely
to a patio or a garden, to Niemeyer’s open pavilion at Gávea. In North America there
was perhaps even wider diversity. Despite the equalization of climate by then readily
provided by heating and cooling facilities, there were still great differences between one
region and another in the forces of nature that must be controlled or protected against,
from the insects and hurricanes of Florida to the blizzards of Minnesota, than between the
various countries of Latin America. Johnson’s Davis house at Wayzata in Minnesota was
enclosed, however, not because of the climate, but in order to provide hanging
space for an art collection, while it opens within on to a patio that can be roofed in
winter (Figure <a href='#i426'>57</a>). Neither screening nor anchorage against high winds is conspicuous
in the design of most of the Florida houses of Paul Rudolph (b. 1918). On the West
Coast the aberrant casualness of the Bay Region manner of the thirties and forties now
became increasingly disciplined. Wooden construction, pitched roofs, and a certain
discursiveness of planning still contrasted, however, with more rigidly Miesian design;
yet the finest houses of Joseph Esherick in and around San Francisco or of John
Yeon in Portland, Ore., to mention only two West Coast architects, sometimes rivalled
in distinction those of Johnson and Rudolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether the building of individual houses in other countries will ever again have the
significance it still retains in the New World depends on many extra-architectural
factors. The last thing a historian should pretend with regard to this or to any other
aspect of the near-present is that he is capable of prophecy. The history of architecture
in the second half of this century can only be written in the future. The glimpses—for
they are no more than that—of post-war production given here represent a critic’s and
not an historian’s selection, and a selection that has inevitably been much influenced by
what that critic knows best at first hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite the obligation to provide in the Introduction some sort of eighteenth-century
foundation, this book had a real historical turning-point for its actual beginning; it had,
in the mid 1950s, no such point at which to end. From Wright, near ninety, to men two
generations younger, some of whom have been mentioned in this chapter, the work of
the architects of the western world showed then no convincing evidence of a major and
general turn, however surprising in the light of his work of the twenties Le Corbusier’s
church at Ronchamp might seem. We stopped in mid-stream and even the <a href='#epi'>Epilogue</a>
which follows can provide no true peroration. Fortunately the contemporary history of
architecture is being recorded more promptly and completely than ever before in the
professional press. It does not seem necessary to footnote this chapter or the <a href='#epi'>Epilogue</a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>with references to periodicals when every issue of the principal journals inevitably
includes material illustrative of current production throughout the world. Yet when
one leaves the world of history for the world of ‘current events’, the time has come to
turn from books to periodicals. In the Bibliography there are naturally few ‘monographs’—i.e.
books or summary articles—devoted to the men first mentioned in this
chapter, since many of them were still at the outset of their careers.<a id="r545"></a><a href='#f545' class='c025'><sup>[545]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>From Papworth’s ‘Cottage Orné’ (Plate <a href='#pl122a'>122<span class='fss'>A</span></a>) to the slabs of Loughborough Road
(Plate <a href='#pl186b'>186<span class='fss'>B</span></a>)—’model’ dwellings both; from the Bank of England to Thyssen Haus
(Plate <a href='#pl191'>191</a>), both housing business as it was never housed before the period with which
this book deals; from Baltimore Cathedral (Plate <a href='#pl005'>5</a>) to Notre-Dame-du-Haut (Plate <a href='#pl167'>167</a>),
the range of notable achievement recorded in this book is not readily outranked in variety
by any other hundred-and-fifty-year period in the history of the western world. As to
the absolute quality of that achievement, as distinguished from what may be called the
‘plot’-interest of various relatively coherent developments continuing over the last
century and a half, it requires a very catholic taste indeed even to pretend to pronounce.
The ‘revivals’ of the nineteenth century and the ‘traditionalism’ of the twentieth century
accepted the dangerous challenge of meeting the earlier past on its own ground, and
this in itself is enough to reduce the absolute value of most nineteenth- and twentieth-century
production. Yet there were renaissances long before there were revivals; and at
almost any given moment of the past most production has been the equivalent in stylistic
retardation of the traditional architecture of the twentieth century. If one must have
originality, these hundred and fifty years have not lacked it, from Ledoux and Soane
to Gaudí and Wright. Of the hundreds of names mentioned in these twenty-five
chapters there are few doubtless equal to Bramante or to Bernini, but how many were
there in the preceding hundred and fifty years? while the variety of approach represented,
from a Schinkel to a Le Corbusier, from a Butterfield to a Mies, is hardly to be equalled
in any comparable period of history. Above all, this is the stage of architectural history
that lies between the unhallowed present and the hallowed past, between the cultural
certainties—if they were so certain—of the eighteenth century and the cultural anxieties
of the present. What we are we can only hope to understand by exploring the immediate
ancestry of our own present. Only revivalists could afford to denigrate and ignore all
that lay between them and some ‘golden age’ they sought to emulate. The future must
build upon the foundations—so very various, so often nearly contradictory—of the
architecture of the last hundred and fifty years.</p>

  <h2 id='epi' class='c013'>EPILOGUE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> five years since the original edition of this book appeared have seen a building
boom throughout the western world such as has rarely been equalled in other post-war
periods; nor has this boom been confined to those countries of Europe and the Americas
with which this account has chiefly been concerned. These have also been years of continuing—indeed
increasing—uncertainty in architectural doctrine. As might have been
expected, various tendencies already touched on in the preceding chapter—both positive
(although often apparently reactionary) tendencies towards greater individuality, and
negative or, at least in the present context, conservative tendencies towards somewhat
tired repetition of pre-war clichés—have not only continued but become much stronger.
The tonality of the over-all picture of current architectural production has by now
definitely changed. That relative balance between what may, at their best, be called the
Miesian and the Corbusian, still maintained almost everywhere in the mid fifties, had by
the early sixties been upset. In hindsight, for example, it must now seem that such
mature and established architects as the Finnish Alvar Aalto and the American Louis
Kahn were inadequately treated in previous chapters—not to speak of such still older
men whose activity has continued or been renewed as the Germans Hans Scharoun and
the late Rudolf Schwarz. Various new names call for attention also: the Dutchman Aldo
van Eyck, for example, the Norwegian Sverre Fehn, the Japanese Tange and Maekawa,
the Italian Viganò, and the English firm of Stirling &amp; Gowan, to mention but a few that
were all but unknown internationally in the mid fifties whose work is now of rising
consequence.</p>
<p class='c010'>For all the evidences of change, it is almost as difficult as it was five years ago to isolate
the common denominator of the new tendencies except in negative terms. It is still
easier to be explicit about what architects are moving away from—what they are
rejecting—than whither they are headed. Any attempt in a few words to describe
positively the present architectural climate faces the difficulty that only in certain
extreme works are novel architectural ideals and ideas wholly dominant; while by no
means all the current building that does <i>not</i> follow in the newer directions, either by
older architects such as Mies himself or by those who have stayed faithful to his canons—whether
intentionally or by default of any alternative allegiance—can yet be dismissed
as merely vulgar, provincial, or <i>retardataire</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rejection of the advanced doctrines of the 1920s and 1930s has rarely been total.
The assumption of some writers, moreover, that there has yet been any serious and concerted
return to Beaux-Arts or other pre-modern standards is, as regards the attitude of
most mature architects—even those who actually have such backgrounds—still something
of an exaggeration. On the other hand, the current sensibilities to which architects
such as Aalto and Kahn, at least, have been successfully appealing—and in Aalto’s case for
some twenty-five years already—are certainly very different from the sensibilities that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>once responded to the crisp geometries, the smooth surfaces, the glass walls, and the
minimal detailing of the Bauhaus (Plate <a href='#pl161a'>161<span class='fss'>A</span></a>), the Savoye house (Plate <a href='#pl159'>159</a>), and the
Barcelona Pavilion (Plate <a href='#pl165a'>165<span class='fss'>A</span></a>). ‘Neo-Brutalism’, or <i>brutalismo</i>, is as dangerous a term
to use indiscriminately as any other critical catchword that has been prematurely
popularized. But it does suggest, at least by a play upon words in several languages, a
current climate of taste which favours <i>béton brut</i>—naked concrete—and rough, usually
rather dark-coloured, materials. Bricks, pre-cast slabs with a coarse aggregate in relief,
or even stone masonry of rubble or quarry-faced granite, with rather heavy trim of raw
or varnished wood and wrought iron, are widely preferred to the slicker, more highly
finished elements that are the natural product of the increasing industrialization of the
building crafts. But this is literally superficial.</p>

<p class='c010'>Associated with the notable shift of preference as regards the texture of the skin, so to
say, of buildings there has been a comparable rise of interest in broken silhouettes, uneven
skylines, masses that are articulated rather than unified, and expressive exposure of
individual structural elements, themselves often sculptural rather than mechanistic in
character. This has affected in varying degree the work of almost all architects from
the most Corbusian to the most Miesian. Windows, moreover, tend to be fewer and
smaller, and their shapes are very likely to be vertical rather than horizontal, slots
instead of ribbons. So also plans now emphasize the particularity of various internal
functions and over-all organization tends towards additive compilation of contiguous
spatial units, in some cases equal or modular, in others disparate in both size and shape.
All this would once have been disapproved by most critics as
under-studied, not to say amateurish, before Aalto’s mature work
became a major international influence
(<a href='#pl173b'>Plates 173<span class='fss'>B</span></a> and <a href='#pl182a'>182<span class='fss'>A</span></a>).
There is surely some reflection of the painting and
the sculpture of the past decade, even perhaps of its most advanced
music, in the apparent intention to suggest freehand improvisation
and randomness in an art whose works, however their designing may have
been initiated, are necessarily in the end products of relatively long
periods of preparatory study and of complex collaborative execution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet to hazard such statements as these, even though they have long applied to much of
the work of Aalto and are now true in varying degree of the production of architects as
different in many basic ways as the Frenchman Guillaume Gillet or the Italian Franco
Albini, is to be reminded of the prevalence of another kind of interest in more elaborate
effects of detail—often denigrated as merely decorative—that is being exploited not only
by such well-established architects as the Americans Edward Stone or Minoru Yamasaki,
on the one hand, and by the German Egon Eiermann, on the other—otherwise quite
opposed as a result of their very different training, experience, and personal dispositions—but
by many others from Latin America to Asia and Africa.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps it may be said in very simple terms that what is widely recognized as the
newest architecture has two aspects, one exaggeratedly masculine, the other almost
daintily feminine. Both are in some cases to be found illustrated, in a curious kind of
rhythmic alternation, by successive works of the same architect; both contrast with the
neutral severity of the architecture of the immediately preceding period. Yet both clearly
have their half-admitted precedents in the varied and even contradictory work over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>many decades of Frank Lloyd Wright and that of the Expressionists forty years
and more ago.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even if it could be accepted, for the moment, that these two tendencies represent the
whole story, few would be impartial enough to admit that they are <i>equally</i> characteristic
of the more serious architectural production of the present. Thanks to a revival of near-Puritanical
asceticism in some quarters, sharply contrasting with the readiness in others
to beguile with somewhat saccharine ‘beauty’, the more masculine aspect has been presented
as superior morally and even as more ‘advanced’; for there are still those ready,
as in the 1920s and 1930s, to plead near-Hegelian necessities for one or another direction
in which architecture may be moving, necessities that are often in patent opposition to
the actual pressures from the aesthetically neutral realm of technology.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the two aspects so far noted do not, in any case, even suggest the full complexity
of the present situation. A third, not necessarily related to the other two yet also,
possibly, subsuming both, is more evident to historians than it is to most architects.
Admitting the danger of pressing analogies with the morphology of earlier periods—the
Gothic, say, or the Renaissance—there is at least a presumption that what we have
known as ‘modern architecture’ is (rather prematurely, it must seem) already in a ‘late’
phase. Recurrent in late phases there have usually been two distinguishable but often
closely related aspects of academicism: a return towards principles that dominated
the arts before the stylistic revolution with which the particular cycle began, on
the one hand, and on the other the reduction to an easily applied system of formal
elements of the painfully evolved features that were peculiar to the preceding ‘high’
phase.</p>

<p class='c010'>But reaction, to give this aspect of the current architectural scene an unnecessarily
denigratory name, is quite likely in particular instances to be more due to the special
circumstances of the current building boom than to any hypothetical life-pattern of
modern architecture. In the first half of the twentieth century economic influences
were supposed, at least, to favour both technological advance in the building sciences
and, concommitantly, ‘advanced’ design in the aesthetic sense. Not always, however,
were the theoretical economies actually realized—or not, at any rate, before considerable
time had passed—and ‘advanced’ design often proved in practice not only expensive but
physically uncomfortable. Then other kinds of technological development, by setting
up even more expensive new standards of amenity, notably in such things as vertical
transport, glare-control, and air conditioning, were already cancelling out the economies
that mechanized methods of large-scale production were eventually making real. At the
same time the inherent practical difficulties of such things as all-glass walls and completely
open plans were increasingly realized as they were ever more generally and uncritically
exploited. By the 1960s some of the technical improvements in building advocated
since the 1920s, notably in the field of partial prefabrication and prefabrication
of larger and larger components—whole sides of houses and flats, for example—had
become widely viable, not to speak of new materials and structural methods that made
certain features relatively easy and inexpensive to provide. Yet total prefabrication of
dwelling units was remoter from realization—except in mobile units such as caravans—than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>a quarter of a century earlier, in part because the public’s willingness to accept
the results of partial mechanization of house-production seemed actually, in many
countries, to have diminished.</p>

<p class='c010'>The major building problems of the post-war world were not and still are not the
production of individual monuments: opera houses, churches, stadia, and the like, on
which professional as well as public attention has tended to focus and for which
drastically new kinds of architectural expression can most readily be invented. What has
been more significant are the large-scale reconstruction of bombed or blighted cities,
the rehousing of very considerable segments of the population, and the provision of the
manufacturing facilities, the offices, and the stores required by greater industrial,
financial, and commercial activity. Inevitably, in a boom period, the very large volume
of production over large sectors of the total range of building has led, in such work, to
a sort of stasis in stylistic development. A vast amount of architectural energy everywhere
must go into the mere carrying out of unprecedentedly extensive plans the
major decisions for which were made as many as ten or fifteen years ago. An inertial
lag is very evident wherever large urban areas, whether cleared twenty years ago by
bombing or in the last few years by schemes of urban renewal, have been or are being
rebuilt. Large parts of the world outside North America, moreover, are only now first
learning how to build very tall structures and hardly yet ready to modify creatively
what they have just learned to do at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last decade, and particularly the last five years, have seen the production of a
great part of the urban and suburban settings in which we will probably be living for the
rest of this century, and doubtless well into the next. Somewhat as the post-Napoleonic
period carried out at an ever lower level of quality the ambitions and aspirations of the
revolutionary architects of the later eighteenth century, so in the post-war years—and
particularly the last five—there has come about the realization of many urbanistic ideals
that once seemed fantastic or Utopian when they were first proposed some forty
years ago. Inevitably there has been a diminution of visual interest when certain modes
of design, first adumbrated in a few unique individual structures or in relatively modest
housing projects in the 1920s by architects of intense conviction and high inventive
power, have been applied wholesale, almost as clichés, by countless other men, usually
much less able and less dedicated, throughout the whole world. Moreover, serious
errors in the original ideals, perhaps only recognizable as those ideals came to large-scale
actuality, have been discovered and denounced. To some critics certain earlier urban
conditions, against whose vices those ideals were first invoked as correctives, have
come to seem, by nostalgia, preferable in various human ways to the ‘brave new
world’ of the 1920s which has, to such a surprising extent, become the real world of
the 1960s.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the reaction against the International Style, thus to describe in over-simplified
form what seems to be the consensus of many of the changes of attitude in the last years,
is by no means as yet a counter-revolution. If the canons of the permissible and the
desirable have been broadened by current theory and practice towards various aspects of
what may still be called the traditional—including, as by now also traditional, much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>that was common to various pre- or extra-international Style aspects of earlier modern
architecture—certain of the presuppositions of the most advanced architects of the 1920s
still seem, though usually in revised form, quite as forward-looking as ever. For the
rather limited aspects of function recognized by the Functionalists (if there ever were
architects truly meriting that name), for example, far more sophisticated conceptions of
function have come to be accepted by most architects whose fields of work are not
industrial or commercial.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet some engineers—the Italian Nervi, whose practice has become international in
scope, the late Spaniard Torroja, the Mexican Candela, the Danish Arup, and the
American Fuller, to mention but a few of the best known—have today reputations
throughout the architectural profession, and even with the public, which neither the
Swiss Maillart nor the lately deceased Frenchman Freyssinet had in their heyday half a
century ago. None the less architecture is not more largely in the hands of the engineers
today than it was earlier despite many prognoses, both pessimistic and optimistic, that
the engineers are, or should be, taking over. Moreover the architectural quality, as distinguished
from the technical ingenuity, of the works of the great engineers is often as
notable as is that of those buildings by certain architects in which engineering principles
are dominant such as Eero Saarinen’s Chantilly airport (Plate <a href='#pl190b'>190<span class='fss'>B</span></a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>These paragraphs have necessarily been of the most general nature and critical rather
than historical. Properly they should be illustrated by a considerable body of carefully
described photographs, plans, and sections such as fortunately can be found in several
current books covering either the whole world, or single countries, individual architects,
or particular types of building. Some of the most useful of those that
had appeared by the summer of 1962 will be found among the additions
to the Bibliography. The few plates that it has been possible to add
in this new edition cannot hope to present a conspectus of the various
aspects of the current situation that have been at least mentioned in
this Epilogue. But the plates of the Seagram Building
(Plate <a href='#pl192'>192</a>) and the Guggenheim Museum
(Plate <a href='#pl188a'>188<span class='fss'>A</span></a> and <a href='#pl188b'><span class='fss'>B</span></a>) may serve as a reminder that
some of the dichotomies of the third quarter of this century in
architecture could, in the late 1950s, be almost as well illustrated
in the work of long-recognized masters of architecture as in that of
men a generation or more younger. The illustrations of the work of
Aalto, work actually of an earlier date, show clearly whence one of
the winds of influence has for some time been blowing; while the plate
of Japanese buildings (Plate <a href='#pl187a'>187</a>) in contrast to the Thyssen
Haus (Plate <a href='#pl191'>191</a>), illustrate the international Corbusian and
the international Miesian of these last years at levels that are
notably high, both in the size and prominence of the structures and,
what is more important, in intrinsic quality.</p>

<p class='c010'>Throughout its length this book has been less concerned with urbanism,
with the architectural macrocosm, than with individual buildings; nor,
for that matter, can photographs give the feeling of the newly rebuilt
central and peripheral areas of our cities even as well as for the
nineteenth century. The character of the Ludwigstrasse
(Plate <a href='#pl010b'>10<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) or the Place de l’Opéra
(Plate <a href='#pl070c'>70<span class='fss'>C</span></a>) can be fairly well apprehended from photographs;
Park Avenue above the Grand Central Station, as rebuilt beginning with
Lever House (Plate <a href='#pl189'>189</a>) in the last decade, or the cities, as
distinguished from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>individual public monuments, of Chandigarh and Brasilia—or even Cumbernauld in
Scotland or Vållingby in Sweden—cannot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Despite all the confusion of architectural doctrine in the early 1960s, despite the vast
areas of undistinguished and even manifestly bad building, these last years have seen
their share of new masterworks, or at least of structures which in our present myopic
view have already been accepted as such. Yet, on the negative side, several of the older
leaders have left us: Wright, Freyssinet, Torroja, Skidmore, Schwarz, and, alas, a few
rather younger men as well: Yorke in England, for example, and in America Eero
Saarinen.</p>

<p class='c010'>Saarinen’s work, since the General Motors Technical Institute completed in 1955 and
illustrated here (Figure <a href='#i419'>55</a>; <a href='#pl168b'>Plate 168<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) which was so very Miesian, came by the late 1950s
to epitomize the variety, not to say the incoherence, of the ambitions of many architects
throughout the world in those years. Happily, after a mature career which lasted only
eleven years compared to his father Eliel’s fifty, his contribution to American, indeed to
world, architecture, culminated in two works, his colleges at Yale
(Plate <a href='#pl185b'>185<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) and his
airport outside Washington
(Plate <a href='#pl190b'>190<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) that in their differing, even apparently opposed,
ways express many of the aspirations of our day at as high a level, perhaps, as earlier
modern architecture ever reached except in the greatest works of Wright, Le Corbusier,
and Mies. But what make Eero Saarinen in retrospect the typical architect of the late
fifties and early sixties are, on the one hand, his Miesian beginnings, in sharp reaction to
his father’s half-traditional romanticism, and on the other the fact that his <i>oeuvre</i> included
many works which in their wilfulness and even, one may say, their frivolity
were well below the median standards of serious achievement in those years. Thus he
stood, to an extent not always realized in his brief lifetime when the kaleidoscopic
diversity of his buildings dazzled those it did not shock, at the centre of his age. His remarkably
successful career, remarkable even in a period—so unlike several of the earlier
decades of this century—when few architects of quality, even the most ascetic or most
fanciful, were wholly without employment, made plain one of the central facts about
these last few years: that the style or movement we call ‘modern architecture’ had in
many, perhaps in most, countries achieved such total acceptance that clients were
willing, almost too willing, to trust their architects in whatever novel direction they
might wish to move, in terms of structure, of materials, and of either asceticism or
decorative elaboration, not to speak of philosophical content.</p>

<p class='c010'>Remembering the extraordinary new developments in architecture that were under
way in the 1760s two hundred years ago in the period with which the Introduction
has dealt, the historian can only end by wondering whether in the welter of innovation
of the last few years there lie somewhere the particular seeds from which the
architecture of the later twentieth and twenty-first centuries will grow; whether, to use
another dubious historical analogy, the stylistic development of this quarter of our
century corresponds to the Mannerism of the central decades of the sixteenth century in
Italy. May we look forward, towards 2000 perhaps, to some such immanent movement,
at once a synthesis of many preceding technical and stylistic innovations and
a return to some at least of the principles of the preceding ‘high’ phase, yet above all a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>vital new creation with a life-expectancy of a hundred years and more, as was the
Baroque around 1600? From the latest Baroque Western European architecture turned
away two centuries ago; to the Baroque, in any revivalistic sense, it is hardly likely to
return. Yet after the ever-increasing divergencies, which have been as characteristic of
the mid century as convergence was of twentieth-century architecture down to the
1930s, will we—perhaps before another decade has passed—begin to sense the beginnings
of a new synthesis?</p>

<p class='c010'>Today, the problem must be posed in world terms. So far Eastern Europe, Asia, and
Africa have, on the whole, been learners and disciples of the West. Will the countries of
Eastern Europe and the new countries of Asia and Africa soon be making contributions
towards a new world-style, such as in the last few decades first the North Americans,
then the Latin Americans, and now the Japanese have made? Will the history of
Western European architecture continue to be the principal story (which thanks to
political conditions has been largely true up to the present) or will the Western European
tradition, to which this volume has been almost completely devoted, become in the
succeeding period somewhat peripheral and even alien to a basically changed situation
in which under-developed countries will increasingly, as they come of age, tend to
throw off cultural tutelage as they have mostly already thrown off political tutelage?</p>

<p class='c010'>The Brazilians could design and build in these last years Brasilia by themselves as well,
perhaps better than Europeans or North Americans—above all, certainly, the architects
of their own Portuguese homeland—could have built it for them. The Indians, on the
other hand, have employed Le Corbusier and other Europeans, and the Iraqis have
assigned the designing and building of their University to an American firm headed by
an architect of German origin. The Japanese, who are in this respect already at the forefront,
had employed Wright half a century ago for the Imperial Hotel; today it may perhaps
be said that their own best work is superior to the Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo
whose designs they obtained from Le Corbusier. Yet current Japanese architecture is not
and is not intended to be—witness the foreign-language editions of two of their
architectural periodicals—outside the tradition of Western European architecture;
indeed, it represents the latest notable contribution to that architecture with which this
book has hitherto dealt. It is appropriate, therefore, that the roster of plates in this book,
which began with buildings conceived—in effect at least—in Rome and built in France,
in England, and even in North America, should end with buildings built in Asia
following principles first adumbrated by a Swiss in France. The later eighteenth century
turned inward in architecture towards the Rome and the Greece that were at the
fountain-head of the Western European tradition; today we should perhaps be turning
outward towards the new non-European world which is still in the mid twentieth
century, in architecture as in so much else, the child of Europe. Symbolically, at least,
the best hope of a new architectural synthesis in the decades to come may lie in this
fact; so that later histories of twentieth-century architecture will perhaps give as much
attention and space to India or to some of the new African states as little Holland or vast
North America have received in this account of the architecture of the last two hundred
years.</p>

the deeper background of theory was French,
not Roman. Unhappily the brevity with which
this whole matter must be treated here, where it is
merely prefatory to an account of nineteenth- and
twentieth-century architecture, makes it impossible
to discuss such French theorists of the early eighteenth
century as J.-F. Félibien (1656-1733), A.-L.
Cordemoy, and A.-F. Frézier (1682-1773); even
Laugier appears somewhat out of context, since he

Doric order provide a measure of the rise of Romantic
Classicism. It is noteworthy that Soufflot
was one of the first to make drawings of the very
archaic Doric of Paestum, but it never occurred to
him to emulate it in his own work. See Pevsner,

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Interest in Egyptian forms can be traced all the
way back through the Baroque period to the early
Renaissance, but it undoubtedly increased after
1750 and lasted well into the next century. See
Pevsner, N., and Lang, S., ‘The Egyptian Revival’,

French <i>pensionnaire</i> C.-L. Clérisseau (1722-1820),
the Late Roman ruins of Diocletian’s Palace at
Spalatro in 1757, and began his brilliant career in
London two years later with the Admiralty Screen
in Whitehall. See Adam, R., <i>Ruins of the Palace of
the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro</i>, London, 1764,

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The present dome is a relatively late emendation;
the original crowning feature was much less
severe. Soufflot sent a pupil named Roche to London
to make measured drawings of St Paul’s in
1776, the year before he prepared this design.</p>

<p class='c031'>In general, the Panthéon appears much more
Romantic Classical today than what Soufflot actually
built. The towers which once rose over the corners
of the portico—in any case disapproved by Soufflot—were
removed by Antoine Quatremère de Quincy
(1755-1849) in 1791, and he also filled up the windows
that originally cut into the plain wall surfaces.
The murals are all of the nineteenth century.</p>

in <i>Architecture in the Age of Reason</i>, figure 169,
dates it around 1808 on the ground that slaughterhouses

It is extremely unlikely, of course, that Hansen ever
saw this project; but the similarity of his tower to
Belanger’s indicates how closely he was in tune
with his French contemporaries. In any case similar
towers are to be found in the projects published by

Schinkel’s more ambitious project for a
palace on the Akropolis was also not carried out.</p>

<p class='c031'>The digging away of the ground, which originally
sloped up to the Palace above the square, and
the introduction in the 1930s of the present retaining
wall with the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
have diminished somewhat the effectiveness of the
front of the Palace.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r61'>61</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The idea for the two-towered façade is probably

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r63'>63</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hittorff and other architects of his generation
such as Henri Labrouste and Duban, who supported
his proposal to revive the external polychromy
they had noted on the Classical temples of Sicily,
were closer in fact to Ingres than to Delacroix.
Ingres in 1828 backed Labrouste’s controversial
rendering of the Paestum temples showing external
colour. Duban, one of the first to introduce polychrome
decoration—the plaques of enamelled lava
used in the entrance courtyard of the École des
Beaux-Arts are his—was a close friend and on occasion
a collaborator of Ingres. Hittorff collected
paintings by Ingres and assisted him with the architectural
backgrounds of his pictures, though that in
the ‘Stratonice’, which gives perhaps the best idea
of the sort of polychromy intended by these architects,
was supplied by Victor Baltard.</p>

still there, but so dulled and begrimed that one
hardly notices it. To the twentieth century the remarkable
roof of Hittorff’s Rotonde des Panoramas
in the Champs Élysées of 1836 would be, if extant,
of more interest, since it was suspended from iron

As might be surmised from its character, a design
was at one point prepared by Gilbert, the principal
Louis Philippe architect for this sort of work.
The actual construction of the Hôtel Dieu by Diet
followed only after a decade of changes of plan, yet
the executed work probably incorporates something
of Gilbert’s design; in any case, what was
built is still wholly in the spirit of Gilbert’s Louis
Philippe work and not at all in that of the Second
Empire (see Chapter <a href='#ch08'>8</a>). Diet was Gilbert’s son-in-law.</p>

the hill-top siting of Monticello, Jefferson’s own
nearby house—begun before the American Revolution
and finally completed only in 1808—this
provision of an open end towards the view illustrates
his active response to the ideals of the Picturesque.
For Monticello, moreover, drawings of
Gothick garden fabricks exist. The fact that McKim,
Mead &amp; White blocked the view at the bottom of
Jefferson’s layout with a new building in the twentieth
century is curious evidence of the lack of
understanding of the essential qualities of the architecture
and planning of this period on the part of
even the most sophisticated ‘traditional’ architects—men
who professed the greatest admiration for
the work of such predecessors as Jefferson and yet
proceeded to destroy its essence whenever the opportunity

that it is difficult to know to whom the credit
should be assigned for its distinguished design. The
competition held in 1838 was won by Walter,
who actually laid the foundations in 1839-40; but
the executed design certainly owes more to the
competition project of the painter Thomas Cole
(1801-48). See Cummings, A. L., ‘The Ohio State
Capitol Competition’, <i>Journal of the Society of
Architectural Historians</i>, <span class='fss'>XII</span> (1953), 15-18. Modifications
of the scheme initiated in 1839-40 were made
with Walter’s assistance in 1844, and building was
resumed in 1848 under the direction of William
Russell West of Cincinnati. On his resignation in
1854 Nathan B. Kelly (1808-71) of Columbus succeeded,
and the work was finally brought to a
finish by Isaiah Rogers in 1858-61.</p>

range of the Picturesque to include considerably
more of nineteenth-century architecture than is
usual. As with ‘Romantic’ or ‘Classical’, it makes a
difference whether or not one uses a capital; with a
capital it seems best to restrict the term Picturesque
to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
although the point of view lasted down into
the fifties, and it is also possible to recognize a sort
of ‘Neo-Picturesque’ in the seventies and eighties

<p class='c031'>The design of 1707 for the façade was by Robert
de Cotte, J.-H. Mansart’s principal lieutenant. The
work was carried on more actively by A.-J.
Gabriel under Louis XV. With the Restoration in
1816 Louis XVIII took up the completion of the
project—which Napoleon had actually ordered
before Waterloo—as part of the general preoccupation
of the Restoration with a strengthening of the
Church, and Charles X opened the finished church
in 1829. Thus the renewal of activity here in the
second decade of the nineteenth century precedes
the other Neo-Gothic work described below by
some twenty years. But credit—or discredit—for
its Rococo-Gothic character belongs to the eighteenth
not to the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r171'>171</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bogardus’s priority in this matter is by no
means absolute. Certainly earlier in America was
the Miners’ Bank, built by Haviland in Pottsville,
Penna., in 1829-30; but here cast iron was used
only to provide a decorative sheathing of the brick
walls in the absence of available stone. Also earlier
was a steam flour-mill three storeys high prefabricated
by Sir William Fairbairn in London in 1839
and sent to Turkey, where it was erected in Istanbul
in 1840. This was more like Bogardus’s building,
and he had probably actually seen it when it was
exhibited in London in Fairbairn’s shops at Millwall
before being disassembled and shipped away.
Daniel D. Badger (1806-?) also claimed priority
because of the many one-storey shops he had
built of iron, one of which was just across Center
Street in New York from Bogardus’s factory. But
Bogardus deserved the publicity he received at
home and abroad; undoubtedly it was his activity
which really started the general vogue of cast-iron

Iron Buildings: their Construction and Advantages</i>,

authority over the façades varied. For the extension
of the Rue de Rivoli, continuation of Percier &amp;
Fontaine’s original design was required; and for the
Place de l’Étoile and the Place de l’Opéra comprehensive
designs established in advance were enforced
(see below). Elsewhere only the height of

were ordinarily standardized by regulation.</p>

Hittorff and Rohault were also collaborating on the
houses surrounding the Place de l’Étoile at this
time. T. L. Donaldson, reporting on the new hotel
at the Royal Institute of British Architects on 22
June 1855, remarked: ‘The roof plays an important
part in the design ... much of the majesty of French
buildings is derived from these lofty roofs.’
Donaldson supervised the erection of the Hope
house, and had thus played a personal part in the
introduction of the French mansard into England
six years earlier.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r188'>188</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is curious that there should be uncertainty
about the authorship of a complex so central to the
building activity of its era. The Grand Hotel which
occupies the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens to
the left of the Opéra was by the team responsible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>for the Hôtel des Chemins de Fer at the other end
of the avenue (see Note <a href='#f187' class='c025'><sup>[187]</sup></a>). Pinkney in <i>Napoleon III
and the Rebuilding of Paris</i>, the latest to discuss the
subject, gives credit for all the façades around the
Place de l’Opéra to Rohault; Hautecoeur assigns
the rounded pavilions opposite the front of the
Opéra to Blondel and mentions no other architect.
Whoever was responsible, Garnier felt they were
much too tall and confining for his Opéra.</p>

like that of Semper, does not fall largely
within any single chapter of this book. Active from
the forties until the seventies, leading restorer of
medieval monuments of his age in France, leading
medieval archaeologist of Europe, controversial reformer
of French architectural education (at least
<i>in posse</i>), author of influential critical books, he was
the inspirer—by his writings rather than his executed
work—of a later generation of architectural innovators
abroad perhaps even more notably than at
home. His failure to conform to the normal pattern
of architectural life that usually confines a particular
man’s significant activity within some one phase of
architectural development—such as, on the whole,
each chapter of this book deals with—makes it necessary
to present his career in piecemeal fashion. It is
partly covered in Chapter 6, with a few further
mentions in this chapter, and—more significantly—in
Chapter <a href='#ch11'>11</a> in this Part and Chapter <a href='#ch16'>16</a> at the
beginning of Part Three. It is worth noting that
Viollet-le-Duc is the only architect who enters this
book in each of its three parts, even though it is
only as an influence, not an executant, that he comes
into the last part.</p>

extraordinary edifice, begun by Alessandro Antonelli
(1798-1880) in 1863, more than rivals his very
tall earlier dome on San Gaudenzio in Novara,
designed in 1840. Never really completed, the
construction of the Mole continued intermittently
down to Antonelli’s death. By its great height and
in some of the technicalities of its construction it
rivals the Eiffel Tower and the early American skyscrapers
which are posterior to it by several decades.
Yet Antonelli arrived at no coherent
expression of his structural innovations and, to
judge from the successive purposes for which the
structure has been intended to serve or has served,
no real capacity to provide a functionally viable
building. On the whole, as its present name implies,
this is a monument chiefly to its designer’s megalomania.</p>

designs were either initiated before his death or
else they were entirely by his assistants, perhaps
directed by his surviving brother Joseph (1795-1875).
A. T. Bolton believed that the responsibility
for the design lay with the builder Trollope; the
Grosvenor Estate office, however, names not Trollope
but the Cubitt firm as the builders. As with the
Place de l’Opéra, the credit—or discredit—for this

he left Dresden as a result of the revolution that
also led to Wagner’s expulsion in 1848. He did no
building in England, but was closely associated with
Cole and his Department of Practical Art. The
catafalque of the Duke of Wellington, used at the
State funeral in 1852, was of his design. His Swiss
period was followed by a triumphant return to
Dresden to rebuild the opera-house there and his
final settlement in Vienna in 1871. Since this relatively
important architect appears, like Viollet-le-Duc,
in unrelated contexts in several different
chapters of this book, it seems well to recall here the
total range of his career from its beginnings in
Hamburg in the forties to its conclusion in Vienna

Construction began only in 1893, long after

Gothic period concluded with the building of two
castles in Ireland, Dromore at Pallaskenny for the
Earl of Limerick in 1867-9 and Glenbegh in 1868-71.
Burges was with him in Ireland when he designed
Dromore, and its decorations and furnishings
rival in elaboration and exceed in elegance
what Burges did for Lord Bute at Cardiff and
Castell Coch in these years. A row with the client
for Glenbegh, who complained of drastic leakage,
in which Godwin’s then partner Crisp deserted
him, did Godwin much harm professionally. He
was still a relatively important figure in the Late
Victorian seventies, but more as a decorator than
as an architect (see Chapter <a href='#ch12'>12</a>).</p>

<div class='footnote c000' id='f261'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r261'>261</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many serious and conscientious English
students of this period would precede such a list
with the name of George Devey (1820-86). Of
Devey, in whose office C. F. A. Voysey, the most
original English architect of the next generation,
chose to work after completing his apprenticeship
with Seddon, Voysey later wrote: ‘Providentially
an invitation came to enter the Office of the most
extensive practitioner in homes for the Nobility
and Gentry. No domestic practice has equalled his
in extent before or since his death.’ As in the case of
William Burn, whose aristocratic practice of the
forties and fifties Devey’s more than rivalled in the
sixties and seventies, neither he nor his clients cared
for publicity, and so none of his work was published,
even to the slight extent that the work of
Nesfield and Webb was illustrated in the professional
journals. Still today his houses are known
to posterity chiefly through a few articles:
Godfrey, Walter ‘The Work of George Devey’,
<i>Architectural Review</i>, <span class='fss'>XXI</span> (1907), 23-30, 83-8,
293-306; and ‘George Devey, F.R.I.B.A., a Biographical
Essay’, <i>Journal of the Royal Institute of
British Architects</i>, <span class='fss'>XIII</span> (1906), 501-25.</p>

<p class='c031'>But just as the work of Nesfield and Webb was
in actuality familiar from the first to their professional
friends and rivals, as also to prospective country
house clients, so was that of Devey. Many of the
stylistic trends so vigorously exploited by Shaw
in the seventies can be traced back to Devey’s
houses of the preceding decade—or so such experts
on the period as H. S. Goodhart-Rendel and John
Brandon-Jones, who know Devey’s work intimately,
always insist. Foreign students of this period,
from Muthesius to the Editor of this series and this
author, perhaps merely because of lack of direct
or even adequate indirect knowledge of Devey’s
houses, have never been ready to grant him so
important a place in the story. Here particularly,
where the story is told in an international context,
the evident strength of the influence of Shaw’s
work abroad even more than at home justifies giving
his primacy and referring only incidentally to
that of Devey.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f262'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r262'>262</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shaw did not immediately succeed Webb,
since the latter stayed on in Street’s office until the
middle of 1859. There must have been close contact
between them over a period of up to a year,
and they remained in touch from then on. Blomfield,
Shaw’s biographer, being himself prejudiced
against Webb, underestimates the reality and the
importance of this relationship. It is only one of the
many errors of fact or emphasis in his book.</p>

<p class='c031'>To quote from a private communication from
Brandon-Jones concerning Shaw and Webb: ‘Each
must have had a good idea of the work the other was
doing. Their two offices, in Gray’s Inn and Bloomsbury
Square, were within a stone’s-throw of one
another, and Lethaby while working for Shaw was
in close touch with Webb and was in his spare time
assisting him with the architectural work of Morris
&amp; Co. It is quite obvious from the dates of various
executed works that Lethaby was carrying over
Webb’s ideas and details and trying them out in
work he was doing for Shaw. As for the mutual
respect and friendship between Webb and Shaw, I
[Brandon-Jones] have recently come across a letter
written at the time of Shaw’s death in which he
[Webb] pays a tribute to his “old friend”, and I
have also seen a letter from Sydney Barnsley to
Sydney Cockerell in which Barnsley says that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>had called on Shaw only a few months before his
death and that Shaw had been talking of Webb and
saying that he still treasured some photographs
given him by Webb nearly fifty years earlier.’</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f263'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r263'>263</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Devey’s incidental work at Penshurst Place
in Kent, where that notable fourteenth-century
manor house was restored by him, having been
done more than a decade earlier, probably prepared
the way for this. It is extremely likely that Nesfield
was familiar with what Devey had done there; but
the line forward leads, in the late sixties, from Nesfield
to Shaw, not directly from Devey to Shaw.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r287'>287</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hunt, of the older generation, was generally
recognized as a leader in this camp also, although
his energies in these years were principally engaged
in designing and building a series of <i>François I</i>
châteaux for the Vanderbilts and other millionaires
that are anything but academic in their involved
picturesqueness.</p>

<p class='c031'>This curious episode, which has been given exaggerated
importance by some historians of American
architecture, began with the designing of the
W. K. Vanderbilt house in New York in 1879-80
(see Andrews, W., <i>The Vanderbilt Legend</i>, New
York, 1941). Other architects were also briefly
affected by what was hardly more than a recrudescence
of a mode popular in France under Louis
Philippe in Hunt’s youth (see Chapter <a href='#ch03'>3</a>).</p>

<p class='c031'>A few houses by McKim, Mead &amp; White of
the early eighties are definitely <i>François I</i>, and
Richardson used <i>François I</i> dormers, probably
independently of Hunt, on the Albany Capitol.
Moreover, the round towers of the ‘Shingle Style’
undoubtedly owe something to Stanford White’s
sketching trips in France. This episode obviously
parallels the interest in revived Northern Renaissance
modes of design in Germany, Holland, and
Scandinavia in these decades, and has analogies also
to the contemporary work in England of George &amp;
Peto and Collcutt (see Chapters <a href='#ch09'>9</a> and <a href='#ch12'>12</a>).</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f288'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r288'>288</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the designing of the Sherman house—particularly
in the Shavian detailing—White had probably
played an important part; he was, moreover,
called on by the Shermans to enlarge the house in
1881. The library, of this date, is one of his finest
pieces of interior decoration.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f292'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r292'>292</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The conceptual organization of the exterior
has seemed to most critics to have been borrowed
from a much later monument, Henri Labrouste’s
Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris of the
1840s, even though McKim would not admit it.
There is certainly none of Labrouste’s exposed
metalwork in the interior; but the extensive use of
Guastavino tile vaults, at this time a real technical
innovation, is worth noting.</p>

less regular than that round the Lagoon in continuance
of Olmsted’s earlier and more naturalistic sort
of landscaping. Into this area were shunted most of
the buildings by local architects, doubtless because
McKim distrusted their capacity to conform to the
academic standards he was setting.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r306'>306</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is worth noting that neither cast-iron
façades nor the vertical articulation of the Philadelphia
buildings of the fifties was used in either
case. Both developments of the mid century proved
cul-de-sacs since the New York architects followed
the established modes of the sixties for monumental
buildings in these first two skyscrapers. In the
same years 1873-4, however, Hunt did build the
five-storey edifice at 478-482 Broadway in New
York with an all cast-iron front, employing a sort
of attenuated ‘giant order’ subsuming the three
middle storeys.</p>

Ornament’, <i>Magazine of Art</i>, <span class='fss'>XL</span> (1947), 110-17.
Sullivan thought of his early ornament as somehow
‘Egyptian’, but it is not very easy to see
why. A later, so far unpublished study by Etel
Kramer seems to establish, contrary to his own
statements, that Sullivan owed a good deal to the
theories of Owen Jones and that his ornament
matured, earlier than has hitherto been supposed,
in 1884-5.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r312'>312</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One must say ‘metal’, because structural
steel was only gradually replacing cast and wrought
iron at this time; all these types of ferrous material
were probably used in the Home Insurance, the
Rookery, and other skyscrapers of the mid eighties.
Two books by W. Birkmire, <i>Architectural Iron and
Steel</i>, New York, 1891, and <i>Skeleton Construction in

Wright on the drawings for a rather Richardsonian
group of three masonry houses in Chicago, designed
in the Adler &amp; Sullivan office in 1888 for

<div class='footnote' id='f317'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r317'>317</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is so generally assumed that Sullivan’s

<p class='c031'>The form of the Burnham firm’s name in these

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r340'>340</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Scully in <i>The Shingle Style</i> provides evidence
that the idea of a great hall was not unknown in
America well before this. It may be unnecessary
to suppose that Richardson knew of the
Hinderton plan, since one or two comparable ones
can be found in books appearing in America in the
fifties; see, for example, the Nathan Reeve house in
Newburgh, N.Y., published as ‘Design No. 22’ in
Vaux, C., <i>Villas and Cottages</i>, New York, 1857.
However that may be, the great hall theme was
rarely exploited in Second Empire or Stick Style
houses of the sixties. It makes a notable appearance
or re-appearance, as the case may be, in Richardson’s
planning just after 1870. See Notes VI-4 and
VIII-2 in the 1961 edition of my Richardson book.</p>

Place in River Forest, Ill., of 1895, notably in the
use of rough boulders at the foot of the brick wall

Ward’, published in the <i>British Architect</i>, 11 April
1890, was apparently never executed any more than
those illustrated the previous year. It is very like
Perrycroft, built in 1893, the first of Voysey’s important
country houses, thus suggesting that on
paper his style had in fact largely crystallized by this
date before his Forster house was begun. It is of
interest that the plan of the Ward project is more
open than those of any of his executed houses; it
may well have influenced Baillie Scott (see below).</p>

originally painted green. At the Forster house they
were of stone, and that is true of almost all the
later houses. So also the slates here were Welsh and
grey; when he began to work in the Lake District he
turned to green slates, earlier used by Godwin on
Whistler’s house. These became standard on his
later houses wherever they were built.</p>

this shared none of the qualities of Eiffel’s temporary

Trocadéro provided a sort of pendant on this side

<div class='footnote' id='f372'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r372'>372</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not perhaps impossible: There is something a
little analogous to Impressionism in the work of
Shaw, though he probably had no admiration for the
art of Monet and his contemporaries in the seventies
even if he was at all aware of it. The same is
true of the American masters of the Shingle Style.
The analogy lies in the casual looseness of over-all
composition and the delicacy of the touch—both
tile-hanging and shingles provide a certain effect of
‘broken colour’ or at least ‘tachiste’ brushwork—even
though they are usually monochrome. On the
other hand, Kimball in his <i>American Architecture</i>,
written a generation ago, saw an analogy to Cézanne
in the return to architectural order in the mid
eighties in America. There is no evidence that
McKim or White then admired any French
painters more advanced than Puvis de Chavannes
however.</p>

France by leading architects throughout the second
half of the nineteenth century: The one that
Viollet-le-Duc provided for the painter Constant
Troyon in the late fifties was of notable interest—in
fact, one of his best works. Moreover, the more
modest <i>ateliers d’ artiste</i> erected by builders provided
much later, in the 1920s, precedents of value to
Le Corbusier and Lurçat. See Banham, R., ‘Ateliers

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r376'>376</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The wallpaper was probably one of those
designed by Heywood Sumner, possibly his ‘Tulip’
according to Elizabeth Aslin of the Victoria and
Albert Museum. This was one of the considerable
range of English papers shown by Jeffrey &amp; Company
at the Salon de l’Association pour l’Art
d’Anvers in Antwerp in the winter of 1892-3.
These papers, which included designs by most of
the English leaders in the field of decorative art,
had already been shown at the Paris Exposition of
1889. It is hard to believe that Horta became aware
of them only when the Tassel house was nearly
finished and not earlier in Antwerp or in Paris. For
the Antwerp showing, see Van de Velde, H.,
‘Artistic Wallpapers’, <i>L’Art moderne</i>, <span class='fss'>XIII</span> (1893),

Gaudí’s technical innovations have been until lately
little studied despite the very considerable literature

made many important innovations in structure
over and above those so evident in the crypt—the

almost wholly occupied with the slow progress of
the Sagrada Familia. Of course, in a sense Horta is
another exception; but his success after 1910 was of
purely local significance and dependent on his total
rejection of the Art Nouveau of his youth. One can
only think of the later career of Giorgio de Chirico,
still today a success in Italy but ignored by the outside

modern architecture (see Chapters <a href='#ch21'>21</a> and <a href='#ch22'>22</a>). That
may be considered to open with van der Meij’s
Scheepvaarthuis of 1912-13 in Amsterdam and to
run out in general sometime in the mid twenties.
It is not apparent that there was any influence of
consequence either way; indeed, the effect of studying
Wright’s work in the war years and the early
twenties was rather adverse to Expressionism and
related tendencies, particularly in Holland where

good many architects who have been for shorter or
longer periods at Taliesin, where the Fellowship has
at times since the Second World War included over
sixty. Those who were at Taliesin some time ago

Alden Dow (b. 1904) in Midland, Michigan,

that Richard J. Neutra (b. 1892), whose work is
of a very different order, was also for a time with
Wright; while there are some architects whose
work is Wrightian to the point of parody who have

with brilliant spatial effect by Jacques Droz (b.
1882) at Sainte-Jeanne-d’Arc in Nice. This was
built in 1932, just at the same time that Böhm was
building Sankt Engelbert. The plan, consisting of
three intersecting ellipses, is very nearly identical
with that of J. B. Neumann’s Baroque masterpiece
Vierzehnheiligen; the result is very different,
however, because of the continuity of the walls and
roof here. Unfortunately Droz’s church was elaborated
with a tower and other features of a rather
‘Jazz-Modern’ order.</p>

It may be remarked here, however, that Candela’s
church is considerably more Expressionist in appearance,
especially the interior, than anything
Böhm ever built in the twenties. Yet its strangely
angular piers and vaults that <i>look</i> so much like the
settings for the ‘Cabinet of Dr Caligari’, the most
famous German Expressionist film, result from
this engineer’s consistent use of the hyperbolic
paraboloid forms which he favours primarily for
technical reasons. De la Mora, Niemeyer, and
Moya were content to use barrel-vault elements of
plain parabolic section such as were first introduced
by Böhm in 1925-6.</p>

stairs is still somewhat Expressionist, but the interior
treatment is in general more related to geometrical
abstract art. The decoration approaches what came
to be known as ‘Jazz-Modern’ when it became
vulgarized in the next ten years or so in England.
The contrast of the interiors that Behrens designed
with the fine examples of Mackintosh’s furniture,
brought from a house that he had remodelled
earlier for the Bassett-Lowkes, appears rather shocking
a generation later. What must have been considered
a bit <i>démodé</i> in 1925 now represents to posterity—at
least in the field of furniture design—the
main line of advance in the early twentieth century;
what then seemed in England to be ‘the last
word’ has dated badly.</p>

widespread only some forty years later, it should be

by no means matured while Loos was in Chicago,
American influence (if any) came probably from the
houses of the Shingle Style. Because of his close

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r436'>436</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The recurrent suggestions of Richardsonian
influence in Europe in the nineties are not yet adequately
explained. Townsend in England knew of
Richardson’s work from American and English
publications, and there was in England one house
by Richardson, Lululund at Bushey, Herts, now
largely destroyed except for the entrance. This was
designed shortly before Richardson’s death for Sir
Hubert von Herkomer, who had painted his portrait,
and executed without supervision. Boberg
had been for a short while in Chicago and Bruno
Schmitz (1858-1916) in Indianapolis; but there are
others whose work also seems somewhat Richardsonian,
such as Theodor Fischer, who certainly had
not. Berlage did not visit America until 1911, when
it was Wright’s work that most impressed him.
He and Fischer might, of course, have known
Richardson’s buildings from publications. For
foreign publications of Richardson’s work before
1900, see pp. 333-5 in the 1961 edition of my
Richardson book.</p>

pupil of Cuijpers who represents a rather different
stream in Dutch architecture of the early twentieth
century, is especially close to that of the contemporary
German leaders but hardly at all related to
Expressionism. His massive office building for the
Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij in Amsterdam
of 1917-23 is quite similar to Behrens’s nearly contemporary
office blocks in Hanover and Düsseldorf,
but much more intricate and inventive in its brick-and-stone

owed anything to the sets that Bakst, Benois, and
others were designing for the Ballet Russe, the
visual investiture of the Diaghilev productions certainly
had a loosening effect on Western European
taste in these years just before the First World War.
For the first time Russia impinged visually on
European art, but that impingement had only an
oblique effect on architecture, for the art that was
exported was not, of course, very architectural.</p>

No two critics will

the work of this generation ‘The New Tradition’

at least, with that of Wright, Perret, Behrens,
Wagner, and Loos, as I have done here.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r443'>443</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That is, Barr proposed the title <i>The International
Style</i> for the book prepared by myself and
Philip Johnson to go with this Exhibition, drawing
the word ‘international’ from the title of Gropius’s
<i>Internationale Architektur</i>. For various reasons the
name ‘International Style’ has often been castigated
since 1932; yet it is still recurrently used, with
or without apology, by many critics. The term is,
for example, used in English and in a rather unflattering
sense by Gillo Dorfles in <i>L’ Architettura
moderna</i>—one chapter is entitled ‘“L’lnternational
Style” ed i nuovi regionalismi’—with no indication
of its origin. Since this term had rather generally
acquired a pejorative meaning, I avoided using
it as far as possible in this book, preferring the
vaguer but less controversial phrase ‘modern
architecture of the second generation’ despite its
clumsiness. For the possible claim that the original
meaning of ‘International Style’, as used by Barr,
Johnson, and myself, still retained some validity
in the early fifties, see my article ‘The “International
Style” Twenty Years After’, <i>Architectural

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r451'>451</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This sort of enclosure has come of late to be
called a ‘curtain-wall’. Some of the skyscrapers of
the nineties in Chicago, most notably Beman’s
Studebaker Building of 1895 and Holabird &amp;
Roche’s McClurg Building of 1899, approached it
very closely, yet in them the actual supporting
piers remained in the façade plane as at the Fagus
Factory and thus the ‘curtain’ was interrupted, not
continuous horizontally. The first true example of
the curtain-wall applied to a large urban structure
followed within a few years after the Fagus Factory,
and certainly with no influence from it; this is the
Hallidie Building in San Francisco, completed by
Willis Polk (1867-1924) in 1918 immediately after
the First World War. But see p. 238 and Note 9 to

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r454'>454</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To those historians of modern architecture
who find its relevant prehistory largely in the
technical developments of the previous century and
a half, the Fagus Factory is the more important; to
those who accept that the architecture of the mid
twentieth century had aesthetic as well as technical
roots, the special ‘classicism’ of Mies’s project, like
Wright’s contact with the American ‘Academic
Tradition’ of the nineties, seems perhaps at least as
important. The thesis of the late Emil Kaufmann,
adumbrated in a series of books from his <i>Von
Ledoux bis Le Corbusier</i> of 1931 to his posthumous
<i>Architecture in the Age of Reason</i> of 1955, stresses—indeed
overstresses—the relevance of the theories
and projects of the revolutionary architects of the
late eighteenth century to the new architecture of
the twentieth century. If it ever becomes possible
to subsume historically under a single rubric the
‘traditional’ and the ‘advanced’ architecture of the
first quarter of the twentieth century, the ‘classicism’
and ‘academicism’ of Wright, Wagner,
Mies, and Le Corbusier as well as of Perret and
Behrens will prove as significant as the technical
feats of those architects who erected the last great
railway stations in these years and the tallest skyscrapers.
Lest the issue seem a simple dichotomy,
Mies’s respect for Berlage’s structuralism should also
be remembered at this point; as also the Expressionism
which influenced both Gropius and Mies after
the First World War, not to speak of Wright’s
‘Baroque’ phase of 1914-24.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r465'>465</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The effect of van Doesburg’s visit to Germany
remains controversial. Although Gropius
denies, or at any rate minimizes, its importance to
the Bauhaus group—and, indeed, personally disliked
van Doesburg—critics and historians mostly
believe the influence of Neoplasticism to have been
at least as significant at this point as that of the
Russian Constructivists. See Zevi, B., ‘L’Insegnamento
critico di Theo van Doesburg’, <i>Metron</i>, <span class='fss'>VII</span>
(1951), 21-37.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>It is not without significance that Gropius included
in 1926 Oud’s <i>Holländische Architektur</i> in the
series of Bauhausbücher which he edited. That
certainly proves a special respect for the <i>De Stijl</i>-nurtured
modern architecture of Holland at the
time.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r466'>466</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Like Le Corbusier’s window-walls, these
horizontal strip-windows, usually called ‘ribbon-windows’
in English, can be traced back at least
as far as Shaw’s work of the sixties, though all the
intervening links are not yet clearly identified.
Their analogy with ‘Chicago windows’ is closest
and, indeed, Sullivan’s Carson, Pirie &amp; Scott
façades, with their wide windows crisply cut in the
smooth terracotta wall-plane, are amazingly premonitory
of the characteristic new window-banded
façades of the twenties. Before this time
window-strips were always subdivided by relatively
heavy mullions in the plane of the wall, as in
Voysey’s houses, or set behind ranges of colonnettes
or other supports, as they were still in the
clerestory of Wright’s Unity Church.</p>

in books of the twenties by European architectural

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r468'>468</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The preoccupation with the shapes of things
that move—which architecture does not—reflects
doubtless the motion-aesthetic of the Futurists.
How well Le Corbusier knew the pre-war projects
of the brilliant Italian Antonio Sant’Elia is not clear.
But his own aesthetic is less related to the particular
forms found in Sant’Elia’s designs for buildings
than to generalized Futurist dreams of speed and
technical modernity. See also Note <a href='#f495' class='c025'><sup>[495]</sup></a> to

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r469'>469</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>However, Le Corbusier’s sketch books make
evident that he had used his eyes to advantage on a
very wide range of buildings in the Mediterranean
world on his early travels, from peasant huts to
the Parthenon, the Campidoglio, and Versailles. His
attitude towards the past was very different, evidently,
from that of the Futurists, of which a somewhat
closer reflection is to be found in the doctrines
of Gropius.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r470'>470</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Throughout this period, and indeed down to
1943, Le Corbusier practised in partnership with
his cousin Pierre Jeanneret (b. 1896); technically
most of his work should therefore be attributed to
‘Le Corbusier &amp; Jeanneret’. No attempt has yet
been made by critics or historians to determine to
what extent Jeanneret deserves credit for the work
of the firm, nor to evaluate the work he has since
done independently.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r472'>472</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The open plan of the Vaucresson house was
more significant than the treatment of the exterior;
that was ‘scraped’ of all features in a Loos-like way,
yet still quite symmetrical, at least on the garden
side.</p>

<p class='c031'>The studio-house for Ozenfant, built on a very
restricted corner site, was too special in its vertical
organization to be very influential. Although today
in good general condition, the very ‘industrial’
saw-toothed skylights on the roof have been removed
and the terrace surrounded with a crude railing.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r473'>473</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Confused by Le Corbusier’s description of
his houses as <i>machines à habiter</i> and the general
‘machinolatry’ of much of his early writing, many
have mistakenly supposed that his was a machine-aesthetic.
Just how to define his aesthetic other than
by begging the question and merely calling it ‘Corbusian’
is, however, far from clear. For an analysis
stressing Le Corbusier’s ‘formalism’, but not in the
pejorative sense of Stalinist criticism, see Rowe, C.,

<div class='footnote' id='f479'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r479'>479</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As building activity increased in Russia in the
late twenties there was considerable experimentation,
mostly along Constructivist lines, and a growing
acceptance of the new architecture of the western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>world. This continued into the early thirties.
But the competition for the Palace of the Soviets of
1931, to which Le Corbusier and Gropius as well as
Poelzig and Mendelsohn were among the over two
hundred architects who contributed projects, represented
a major turning point. This was won by the
Soviet architect B. M. Iofan (b. 1891) with a very
monumental scheme designed in a variant of that
megalomaniac mode of scraped classicism which
had been popular for large-scale architecture in Germany
under the Second Reich and which returned
to favour in 1933 under the Third Reich, just after
Iofan’s scheme triumphed. By 1937 this relatively
severe project had been elaborated by Iofan and his
collaborators W. G. Helfreich and V. A. Schouko
until it rose—and to the same tremendous height as
the Empire State Building in New York—like a
telescopic wedding-cake, terminating in a statue
of Stalin a third as tall as the whole structure
below.</p>

<p class='c031'>Henceforth the ‘scraping’ of Classical forms ceased
and Stalinist architecture in general aimed at an
elaboration that was at once Baroque and Victorian
in its coarse exuberance and in its illiterate use of
academic clichés all but forgotten in the western
world. During the later Stalinist period official
Soviet criticism decried the modern architecture of
the western world as a manifestation of ‘bourgeois
formalism’.</p>

<p class='c031'>Since the end of that period the denunciation of
its characteristic architecture by Soviet leaders implies
some return towards the contact with advanced
western ideas which was evident in the
twenties and early thirties. For the production of the
Stalinist period, which would rate anywhere else
as very low-grade ‘traditional’ architecture, see
<i>Dreissig Jahre sowjetische Architektur in der RSFSR</i>,
Leipzig, 1950.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r481'>481</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gropius and Meyer first used a smooth
rendered surfacing on a theatre at Jena that they
remodelled in 1922; this was not otherwise very
significant, except that no trace of Expressionist
influence, still strong in work of the year before,
remained. As will appear shortly, Mies van der
Rohe proposed to use brick in a design for a country
house in 1922; and all the private houses he
built in the twenties are of that material, though his
housing blocks at Berlin and Stuttgart were rendered.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r482'>482</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although Mies is not, as his second name
van der Rohe might suggest, Dutch, he has always
been an admirer of Berlage, and his very high standards
for brickwork derive from his knowledge of
Dutch building, both old and new, acquired during
the year spent in The Hague designing the Kröller
house.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r495'>495</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If Expressionism in architecture is an episode
difficult to assess despite the real achievement of
several of the architects involved with it
(see Chapters <a href='#ch20'>20</a> and <a href='#ch22'>22</a>), Futurism is impossible to evaluate at
all since it was only a ‘might have been’. Italian
modern architecture since the thirties does not derive
from the projects of Sant’Elia, many of which
are only now being studied for the first time.
Sant’Elia and the other architects associated with
Futurism wished to cut all links with the past,
Terragni re-linked the ‘International Style’—usually
called <i>architettura razionale</i> under the Fascist
regime—with Italian tradition, a line which several
Italian modern architects have followed since. See
Sartoris, A., <i>Sant’Eliae l’architettura futurista</i>, Rome,

work, this ‘baby skyscraper’ of 1939-40 and also
the contiguous Exchange by J. F. Staal (1879-1940),
designed in 1929 and built in the thirties, appear
much more ‘modern’ to mid-century eyes than
the first big banks and so forth rebuilt after the war—these
look as if they had been designed at least a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>generation ago. But the wave of reaction soon ran
its course; the Lijnbaan of 1953-4, a complete shopping
street by van den Broek &amp; Bakema running
parallel to the Coolsingel, if not the new Bijenkorf
by Breuer of 1955-7, was among the most advanced
projects carried out anywhere in the mid
fifties.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r511'>511</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Historicism’ is a clumsy term matched by no
viable adjective. It does, however, express more
accurately than ‘traditionalism’, ‘revivalism’, or
‘eclecticism’ a certain aspect of architecture which
was common throughout the last five hundred
years, and not unknown in early ages. Quite simply,
it means the re-use of forms borrowed from the
architectural styles of the past, usually in more
or less new combinations. It is late in this book to
introduce a definition; but historicism is always so
much taken for granted in discussing the architecture
of the nineteenth century that it is only
after the appearance as an alternative of exclusive
modernism, rejecting all borrowed forms, that the
older attitude needs to be isolated in order to discuss
its continuance in this century. Characteristically,
the architecture of two-thirds of the period
covered by this book balanced a moderate sort of
modernism with more or less of historicism. This is
as true of most of the novel projects of Ledoux in the
1780s as it is of a considerable part of the work of
the first generation of modern architects. However,
only the traditional architects remained firmly
attached to the concept of historicism in the
twentieth century; men like Behrens and Perret
were, through much of their careers at least, in
highly significant revolt against it, quite as Ledoux
had been in his day.</p>

to the death of their associate Joseph M. Wells in
1890. Never a member of the firm, he had nevertheless
been personally responsible for the design of
the Villard houses (Plate <a href='#pl109b'>109<span class='fss'>B</span></a>) that had opened the
academic phase of the firm’s career. Later, the death
of White and the retirement of McKim in the early
years of the new century removed the two controlling
personalities from the firm. Henceforth the
office was a ‘plan-factory’, with high professional
standards undoubtedly, but without direction
other than that already established in the late
eighties and nineties by the founders. In 1961 the
firm finally came to an end with the death of J. K.
Smith, the only surviving partner who had known
the founders.</p>

who had worked with Garnier on the Opéra and
succeeded Labrouste at the Bibliothèque Nationale,
had at least as high a reputation, and was the teacher
of several prominent English and American architects.
His severe academic style, emulated later by
his Anglo-Saxon pupils, was well established by the
time he designed the Faculty of Medicine at Bordeaux
in the early nineties. Nénot was one of
Pascal’s French pupils.</p>

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r516'>516</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The controversy as to which firm should receive
credit for the design of the Grand Central
Station once waxed hot. The organization of the
tremendous complex was probably the work of
Charles A. Reed (?-1911) and Allen H. Stem
(1856-1931), who had already built other big
stations in Troy, N.Y., in 1901-4 and in Tacoma in
1909-11—as, moreover, their successors, Felheimer
&amp; Wagner, have done also: Buffalo and North
Station, Boston, both begun in 1927, and Cincinnati
in 1929-33. Whitney Warren (1864-1943) and
Charles D. Wetmore (1866-1941), who also
worked with Reed &amp; Stem on the Detroit station
completed in 1913, were doubtless more responsible
for the dignified and well-scaled detailing.

University School of Architecture, G. H. Edgell,
offer the later writer very little assistance. Kimball
in the twenties was too ready to consider the
continuance of the academic tradition assured—his
chapter on Sullivan and Wright was entitled
‘The Lost Cause’—while Edgell offers such a miscellany
of buildings that no clear picture emerges.
Several attempts within the period to select its
major monuments fixed on much the same lot as are
given prominence here; but such selections hardly

<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r520'>520</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>‘Compositionalism’ has been suggested by
Colin Rowe as a name for the style-phase with
which this section deals. Composition was then
conceived by many architects and theorists as an
absolute to which the re-use of any sort of stylistic
forms could be accommodated. It is at least open
to suspicion, for example, that Rogers’s Pierson
College at Yale was designed originally with Gothic
forms and then re-cast as Neo-Georgian. Later
eyes than our own will doubtless find it possible to
identify the period characteristics of traditional
work of the twenties in the way many critics already
feel able to do with the nineteenth-century revivals.
The period-designation ‘President Harding’ may
some day perhaps be as meaningful as ‘General
Grant’, if hardly comparable to ‘Victorian’!</p>

</div>
<p class='c020'>For the study of the architecture of the western world since about
1840 no sources are more valuable than the professional periodicals.
To provide a comprehensive list with full bibliographical details
would require an inordinate amount of space and many technicalities
because of the complicated way such publications start and stop,
initiate new series, merge, and change title. However, it may be
helpful to mention, without giving any descriptive details, a few that
are especially valuable to the historian. In England, the
<i>Builder</i>, the <i>Building News</i>, and later the
<i>Architectural Review</i> are most useful; in France the <i>Revue
générale de l’architecture</i>, the <i>Encyclopédie
d’architecture</i>, the <i>Gazette des architectes</i>, and later
<i>L’Architecture vivante</i> and <i>L’Architecture d’aujourd’
hui</i>. In Austria-Hungary the <i>Allgemeine Bauzeitung</i> may be
cited. For the United States, the <i>American Architect and Building
News</i> and later the <i>Architectural Record</i>, the
<i>Architectural Forum</i>, and <i>Progressive Architecture</i> cover
the field from the eighteen-seventies to the present. The American
<i>Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians</i> has devoted
more articles to the nineteenth century than other learned journals.
Particular articles in the above-mentioned and other periodicals are
for the most part merely referenced in the Notes, except those that
provide the equivalent of separate monographs on certain architects;
such are listed here.</p>
<p class='c010'><i>General Works</i> are subdivided, necessarily with some overlap,
into those covering the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> (including, in fact,
the later decades of the eighteenth also) and those covering the
<i>Twentieth Century</i>. There follow rubrics for separate countries
or groups of countries. Finally come the monographs on individual
architects arranged, regardless of country or period, alphabetically
by architect.</p>

  <h2 class='c013'>INDEX</h2>
</div>
<p class='c020'>Numbers in <i>italics</i> refer to plates. References to the Notes are
given only where they indicate matters of special interest or
importance: such references are given to the page on which the note
occurs, followed by the number of the chapter to which it belongs, and
the number of the note. Thus 455(13)<a href='#f287' class='c025'><sup>[287]</sup></a> indicates the note is on
page <a href='#Page_455'>455</a>, it is referenced from chapter <a href='#ch13'>13</a>, and is note <a href='#f287' class='c025'><sup>[287]</sup></a>
within the body of this book.</p>
<p class='c010'>The system followed in towns and cities is to print the name of the
building first, followed where applicable by the name of the street in
which it is located and by the district or suburb. Thus the White
House, Tite Street, Chelsea, will be found in the main London entry
under White House, and Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Neuilly, in the main Paris
entry under Saint-Jean-Baptiste; each, however, is cross-referenced in
the main index, as Chelsea, <i>see</i> London (<a href='#LondonWhite'>White House</a>).
More remote suburbs generally have separate
entries. Country houses are entered under their own names rather than
under nearby towns and villages.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
